# SFIA (Isaac Arthur) Podcast Channel Summary and Recommendation Bot

[Science & Futurism with Isaac Arthur](https://www.youtube.com/@isaacarthurSFIA) is one of my all time favorite channel that discuss a variety of topics related to imagining what the future might look like. 

This project is an NLP tool to summarize and recommend SFIA's large collection of almost 700 episodes (Every episode before June 20th 2024) to new audience and old ones alike. The bot will take a query from the user in the form of a general question about the future and give a synopsis on what was discussed in the podcast with regards to that topic.

The bot uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and various text and image generation LLMs to achieve this task.

The repo contains code to build the bot and deploy it on a Lambda function on AWS.

This project was inspired by the tutorial from [pixelgami](https://www.youtube.com/@pixegami). Check out his channel for more awesome tutorials!
