One common solution suggested for the Fermi
Paradox is that older alien civilizations
all remain quiet because the galaxy is a dangerous
and dark forest full of predators who might
come get you if they hear you.
The problem with this approach is that it
is assuming anyone with interstellar space
fleets available to them needs to hear a radio
signal.
That some civilization dedicated to hunting
for any weaker civilization to wipe out would
wait for signals and send warships, instead
of hunting for biosignatures of planets that
are visible billions of years earlier than
techno signatures would be.
An occasional probe sent to or even past a
planet would detect things like fires or canals
or pyramids many millennia before a radio
ever got built.
Whatâ€™s more, unless you have a time machine,
you can't go back and erase your radio signals,
which they will have heard, or your more primitive
bio and techno signatures.

Paradox Compendium of Solutions & Terms.
