good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink
and a snack though we'll take a break
about halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
our show we're just gonna double check
real quick that all of our audio and
visual is working correctly for change
since we had that fun glitch at the
beginning of
last month's episode with no audio for
two minutes and go ahead and talk in
your questions and now while we
have a chance to detect that and if
anyone who's in the uh
check and go ahead and confirm that they
can hear me that would be appreciated
so what's our first question from last
month while we have those command
yeah albert jackinson had uh asked if
gravitons do in fact
exist and we learned to create them and
or harness their properties what
technology applications would they have
uh the key thing about gravitons is a
lot like neutron beams they're one of
those things where you can find a
material that actually reflects
gravitons or let you
twist which direction they're going uh
so they're not just omnidirectionally
emitting that's what lets you do a lot
of things like anti-gravity
or maybe create a singularity particular
spot you wanted or do some of the warp
drive stuff that people tend to like to
think about doing
that's the big thing you do if you have
artificial graviton creation
and that's one of the two types of
grazer as opposed to a laser or meso
there's a gravity laser which is a
grazer and there's a
gamma ray laser and they're both uh
completely different but also both stuff
from the thing that
can't be made because we're not only as
reflective of those materials either one
would be awesome to have though
so we had another question on how you
think convergent evolution would affect
life from different
biospheres it kind of depends on if we
mean convergent evolution socially or in
what biological sense
we would have very little reason to
think that random mutation would take us
back to a particular modal but
you'd expect like we think eyeballs have
evolved multiple times for instance
socially though like i think what people
mean by convergent evolution most cases
is not like a biologically
same body but more of a socially same
unit and in that case that's
we can look at examples from our own
civilization you know um
in places where they've kind of come
back the same idea there's only so many
ways you can build a road
and some ways you have a better chance
of getting convergent socially than
biologically because
anything that's based off logic and kind
of take you to the same location
eventually is the idea
but it's still a bit of a long shot to
assume a culture will come the same
thing they probably make screws the same
as we make screws
they'd probably make an axe or wedge the
same uh their automobile might have four
tiles
but at the same time there's gonna be so
many differences that those
similarities will be minuscule probably
well i see the questions are rolling in
so kicking off today we have a question
from
about technological singularity with
animal
gupta is it necessary that warp drive
need
only exotic matter it
it so much depends on how you define
exotic matter um
the thing is all the matter we know of
right now causes
gravity and space time to condense when
you and you're doing things with it in
which case it is warping space-time but
not in the way we want
to do any kind of warp drive relies on
expanding space in front of you
sorry contracting in front of you
expanding behind you which means you
need some sort of metal that will uh
expand space rather than contract it
we don't know any such type of matter so
anything that would do that would be
exotic by definition but
there's a lot of different hypothetical
exotic matters that could do the trick
we don't know if anything though i i was
just laughing i saw a super chat from
eric johansen
saying finally i didn't miss the live
stream
welcome back we're gonna have to wait
for his question though because i have a
few more in front of them
um tio tom tazter what are your opinions
on the world
building to sleep in the sea of stars
sleep in a sea of stars what might be in
the world building is it a story what
are your opinions on the
world building of to sleep in a sea of
stars i think that is a story yeah i'm
afraid i don't know that story
uh if you want to leave that one in the
comments i can check and see if it's
what i've heard of otherwise but
i don't know what i'm afraid all right
question from paul
shields will you comment on the recently
released governor reports
on uaps i think simon had a comment
about that too
let's see um no
it's we did the we did an episode last
year on the navy ufos
and it is something we should probably
get to um
joe scott um he did a good initial video
on that too
um discussing a little bit we will do
one but
i haven't had a chance to really dip it
in deep detail and i think
everyone knows the channel knows that
i'm obviously on the skeptical side but
i'm not gonna
just go in and say oh it's all nonsense
or oh this this is
you know changing my mind until i've had
a chance to really dive into it and
i usually means i see other people's
analysis on a lot of the aerial stuff
because
i'm not an aerospace engineer so i can
miss little stuff
you know that that somebody else can buy
and say that's obvious and
i really am kind of waiting to hear
other people's thoughts on it and have a
chance to really structure mine before
we do another video on that but
when would stale we'll probably do one
johnny wing
says so isaac i know you're a big fan of
fusion
but do you think it would be possible
for us to figure out anti-matter
and a leap past fusion as a main energy
production method
the problem with creating antsy matter
ignoring all the storage issues is that
it would probably be very hard to ever
create antimatter
in an energy positive way which makes a
great battery storage you can do it like
even two to one that's great for fuel
you make it some big facility store it
up and use it
um but what's more likely is that it'll
be a very high energy production thing
of where maybe even 101 might be
possible and that would be amazing
uh in which case something like
antimatter catalyzed fusion
which we use a little tiny amount of
antimatter set up a whole bunch of
fusion reactions
um in a much tinier bomb uh you know
which little pellet size thing
that becomes your energy producing drive
method that's very good and fusionish
if you can produce antimatter cheap
enough obviously even if you can't
produce it
at a profit that's still a great a great
spaceship fuel
um but you know i think a black hole
drive for instance has some advantages
even then because
you can't produce the animal for free on
the way but you can suck matter in for
the black hole and shoot out so
there's ups and downs with all these
strides you know walking but antimatter
is
your best fuel if you can make it
cheaply installed safely
so that would be better than fusion
speaking of albert jackinson he's back
and he says good afternoon isaac i had a
medical incident last week and that got
me to thinking about the medical field
as you might expect
what medical technology do you expect to
see emerging in the next century
well hi albert and uh welcome back uh
probably one most prolific question
asked was down there yes
um i hope you're feeling better what was
the question again i just completely
lost track of it
what medical technology do you expect to
see emerging in the next
century in the next century a lot of
them i mean you got to think about how
much we've had to develop in the last
century your pacemakers all your cancer
treatments
um virtually every cure we have
is either modern polished in last
century or completely invented in the
last century
medical nanotechnology the big one um
the ability to genetically
geo things that can do a lot of fixing
up or virus killing
retroviruses almost everything we
discussed in that biotech
episode to be honest from about two
months ago um
and uh i would go bound to that one and
the post-human video we did right before
that
really talks about a lot of those
options and i hope you feel better about
watch
um eric herzl since
no solution to the fermi paradox is
sufficient what do you think of
quote all the solutions you've covered
adding up to another great filter
um i mean not all of them in the sense
of some of them are contradictory of
course
um or would be physically impossible but
the usual idea for the great filters
is is that you might luck out with one
that's like the billion and one odds
but it's more likely that it would be
one of those things but adds up a lot
um i would tend to say you're gonna have
some of them that are the big ones the
one a million odds but you're just gonna
have this
stack of even those will be probably
something you could divide into
subcategories that have better odds each
but you have the stack of
small improbabilities are just going to
stack up to make it virtually impossible
is my guess
that is a good point though we don't
actually have any good answers the 40
paradox we have least bad ones even the
ones i favor are the least bad
man lesser x123 wants to know what's
your education
it's good to know they can count
who's gonna know who can get one well
they have one two three in
their title so they want to know what
your education
is uh sarah and i actually both
homeschooled by the way introduced my
wife uh
she is uh the lovely assistant reading
us questions this week um
and uh i guess i got my gd back in 1996
when i was 16.
and i started college at kent uh local
school first
uh to keep me home then i finished my
bachelor's there and stuck around for
grad school
i did a little over two years of grad
school
about 60 some credit hours so past the
master's level but
not in the thesis zone and uh left for
the army
when i came back i had zero desire to
ever go back to it though but um
i'd say ninety percent of what i've
learned in life has been just out of
books
films tv you know educational things
audiobooks that is the best education
you can always get but
i would say for things like physics and
math it is very handy to actually have
access to professors to help you stick
you on the right path too
so but that's the background education
there
isaac bordeaux also wants to know what
your thoughts are on string theory
welcome back isaac
you know we were just writing an episode
on um what was it i was writing this on
student theory came up and this would be
one of the episodes like september
october because that's where we're at
right now
uh so the oh the edge of the universe
for
august 26th um episode 305
uh where he brought up kind of the
concept of string theory and
the thing is i like string theory as a
concept it is probably one of our best
models but i have so tend to often come
off on it very negative because
while it's the best model i know of i do
feel like way too often theorists or
popular media
imply that this is some kind of almost
proven or
nearly so locked in thing like
relativity
it is not there is literally zero
physical evidence for string theory or m
theory
or multiverses or copenhagen
there was no evidence it's not like
neutrinos where it was hard to get
evidence we got a little bit it's like
dark matter we have evidence all over
the place we just can't nail the
individual bits down
we don't have any evidence to back them
up what we do have is support
mathematical models that fit it
and uh mostly and that's often a good
place to begin that's how we found
quarks for instance and neutrinos
but at the same time my opinion string
theory is it's our best model though
i tilt to m theory um which is six of
one half dozen yellow
um but i don't like to treat them as
hard signs yet on the other hand i'm not
a pure pawprint i
don't think that you can say that string
theory isn't signs because it doesn't
have any evidence it's in that
hazy zone of where you would be nice to
have some physical evidence but you
can't just stop doing science because
you can't get the ideal
scientific you know theory approach to
hypothesis there you though
annabelle cassas well we get so much
hate mail from cosmologists after that
annabelle casa says what would life be
in a galactic empire and can you make a
video about it
that was i think the galactic domination
series that we're doing this kind of
that we did do a
interstellar empires one too but the new
galactic domination series is kind of
trying to look at
if this was the goal of that
civilization of this reason they were
taking over a galaxy
uh you know what's the what's the
motivation and we started with the big
one there of
we have this empire just because we want
an empire and we don't want anyone else
to have it
and the one that comes up this upcoming
week um
uh is going to be looking at what if
your big goal is just resource
utilization what if the reason you have
an empire is you want to grab everything
then we got the galactic laboratory
coming up which is you know what if your
motivation is just science
right that's the big push motor for your
empire
and that is when we try to look at
galactic empires because they're so hard
to put together
under known signs so even though once
that out of fashion light travel
you have to know what is that big
motivation that keeps everything
together
and that's what we'll explore in that
series okay i want to give a few shout
outs here to our super chats
you did mention simon farmer he gave a
super chat of ten dollars and he also
had a similar question on the uap
pentagon report
and he says thank you for building a
great community we also had a super chat
it looks like
10 pounds from samuel dominguez lorenzo
and he says thanks for all the awesome
content isaac
and alaska alaskan ballistics
also a 10 super chat if it if matter
and he has a question if mata was closer
together
in space and closer in time to the big
bang
would time have been slowed down
compared to our normal time
being so much mass in one place yes but
no
um there's another thing we discussed
that edge of the universe episode we're
discussing that's kind of our hyperspace
episode there too because we're back in
the fashion light series um
and uh i think we're cheating reality
coming up shortly as the first one of
that
um you could jump into a congruent
universe and move through it with small
like that pop back into a new one if you
had some way of doing that
and expect to come out having traveled
faster than light relatively speaking
but just be inside a universe where
everything's slowing down time wise
everything's slowing down time wise but
the nature of our assumption how
universes work right now which again is
something we'll get more in that episode
is that the whole thing is doing
that if everything's slowed down and
then relative to watch there's nothing
to compare it to because that's
everything
so that's kind of the context for that
time would be
running slower but no one's there to
measure it as it will
so um captain frantic says are you an a
theory or a b theory of time
i don't have any official time one uh
the air of time questions that come up
for your zig zag gravity is it dark
energies on the popular one i don't have
what i subscribe to
i do not have even a mode for how we
think of time that i subscribe to
i just work with minkowski space for the
purpose of relativity and then leave the
philosophizing up to uh those who are
better suited to that or myself when it
so inclines me
also a question here from joey he says
if you could move back in time
and move distance and then rapidly go
back to the future would you move vast
distances across space without
expedience
exceeding the speed of light was that
just a hyperspace question again
can you read that one again so i got to
stretch i think it is very similar to
that question we had earlier but it's
from a different
audience member joey if you could go
back in time
and move a distance and then rapidly go
back to the future
would you move vast distances across
space without exceeding the speed of
light that is actually something we
talked about that that same video i was
just mentioning that is
the idea is not to go to your own
universe that's where you say congruent
universes because you're going backward
in time the question then becomes
um why are you going forward in time
again you know why not just colonize
that universe back then or something
like that so
but yeah that's exactly what would
happen if there was congruency that way
that's the question is if i if i jump
back in time 10 minutes here
am i landing here or am i landing how
much the earth is spun in 10 minutes or
how much the earth has orbited in 10
minutes etc
okay we have a psycho x team question
what do you think of kessler syndrome
being a possible solution to the fermi
paradox
it doesn't work out as one kessler
syndrome uh is the name for when a space
debris event
um starts to spell um and you get a
whole bunch of
debris scat all over the place that
makes more debris you know i i
have a piece of debris satellite that
satellite explodes sends out more debris
which it's other satellites and
next you know you have a big cloud of
matter all around the planet i think the
first time i became familiar with that
idea was actually from
palladium's rifts game as that was the
reason why the planet earth was trapped
off in space in the post-locked
post-apocalyptic future was there was
kessler syndrome all around that keeping
them from their space habitats on the
moon
um but the problem is space debris
doesn't last forever it goes away
it can be cleared it's very hard to do
we were talking about that a little bit
yesterday at the international space
development conference that the nss put
on
uh for those of you who caught that um
it's basically problematic move but
it can't be removed and it goes away on
its own so it really doesn't fit that
constant problem situation that would
fit it
we have a few questions about upcoming
episodes or if you've done an episode
recently on
a topic um the first one is do you plan
on going back to
event horizon again anytime john invites
me
probably probably any time john invites
me on it sounds like they're thinking
about it
cindy says he's there they're
in the process of thinking about that um
have you spoke vi sci-fi says have you
spoken on proposed global governments
uh well i've like every other young
person in my lifetime rant about any
number of governmental systems down the
years um we actually have an episode we
had an episode on it the geopolitics of
space coming up with uh
what if art hist uh the art history
channel that rudyard runs
uh he'll be looking more at the current
governments potentially doing that than
i will be i'll be more saying
the stage but that episode will come out
in july and silver comic says hi isaac
what do you consider the greatest
failure mode of futurists of the past
um you know i've seen what henry ford
said if you ask people what they want
they'd say build me a faster horse
um that's the the one that we all get
there's there you get stuck in the
problem the present
uh this happens a lot my colleagues who
talk about space travel in general is
they are so naturally lash on to trying
to figure out how to get the lightest
you know how to get space travel going
with really light ships they tend to
read about some of the changes the
problems exist if you have
cheap energy for instance you can
suddenly have you know a meteor thick
home on something
uh we all get kind of stuck in those
modes that's not just the future
something but that tends to be a
faster horse yeah i think i i think this
one
is uh one you've also done an episode on
recently
uh time zone says hi isaac how do you
think
if a completely automated alien
sleepership does a gravitational
maneuver around our sun with no effort
of communicating with humans
how do you think that people will react
i'm sorry one more time
um how do you think a completely
automated
alien sleepership if they did a
gravitational maneuver around our sun
with no effort
to communicate with humans how do you
think that people would react
could we see a more more if i i always
mispronounce that i think
fragile kane from universe today once
walked me through how to actually
pronounce that and i still can't get it
right
but we had that one exo uh exostellar
asteroid that came through that was
shaped like a cigar and the question was
whether that was a sleepless ship or not
and i said wow we you know we lucked out
and saw one exactly we did luck out and
see that once we saw it we can't keep
track of it though
um that would be kind of your odds on
seeing a sleeper ship based on its size
um except that they really shouldn't
have a slingshot in this close to the
sun um
and uh we probably have millions of
those past through the solar system any
given
you know century so and you had an
episode on that correct
you had an episode on sleeper ships yeah
we do have an episode on sleeper ships
yeah that's
more of the idea of us building them and
the problems with them though but yes
very undetectable and relatively
speaking
uh question from back down on the boat
what kind of governance do you think
spacex will create in their upcoming
mars colony
and the the side commentary is that eli
won't answer my tweets
um i think it would be a really bad idea
for anyone that
yeah you don't casually start up your
own new government
it takes a long time and here's the
thing if you certainly play yourself a
country of 10 000 people
um i live in a tiny rural suburb
of a tiny city of 20 000 people
uh in a relatively unpopulated county of
100 000 in
a state of 10 million and i don't think
ohio even is one of the biggest states
out there could really push around like
either us or china or things like that
say hey we're independent
let alone could the little village i
live in you need probably to have a
population of hundreds of thousands
before you could ever
achieve political independence or your
own governmental system in modern
context
because you have to offer services to
people and
you know who's who's one of your courts
how many judges do you have uh with a
colony of a thousand people
uh how many doctors do you have and are
they are specialists
and what do you do if all the other
countries say hey we're angry at you now
we're embargoing you so you're on your
own we're not gonna shoot you which is
gonna tell you you're all on your own
that's a problematic situation to be
unless you've got a really big
population
so especially in outer space yeah where
everything is hostile and designed to
kill you
denver sanchi says what do you think the
most likely form
of faster than light is i believe that's
what he means he put ftl
yeah yeah that is it um well the most
likely me is none at all
again i really don't think we'll ever
get that but if i had to guess i would
say probably the hyperspace portions of
it where you could
if there are parallel realities that you
can move between
um that would be the one you would be
able to probably most likely do is i can
glue it and
shift but i don't think any other very
prompt would be something we could do
ever
okay on that lovely note lucas spren
wants to know if you have read the
fundamentals of astrodynamics and
whether or not you would recommend it
looking over the shelf to see if you
know the title of that without me
knowing it
uh no no i don't have that particular
book i'm trying to
the actual name of the astrophysics
books i have um that was
i had astrophysics with dr mark man that
he was my undergrad advisor too though
this was a grad
class um way back in like 2001 or two
and i think we we did use a book for
edge camera it was called
all right we have a question here from
wynton ashley and
and thank you wynton for your ten dollar
super chat
he says isaac there's anti-matter and
matter but what about
neutral matter could it touch
both without exploding maybe it could
solve antimatter storage
being able to store it in neutralium
powder or foil uh that's one of those
ones that's probably best answered by
watching our antimatter episode but
kind of the short film on that we have a
habit of saying that antimatter and
matter when they touch explode
that is not really true what happens is
whenever you combine two things with
very different setups there that are
opposite
the event will take place that
reshuffles everything around one of the
most likely reshuffles
of all the valence and c quarks beyond
there is
a pair of big photons which effectively
we have a ton of it is an explosion same
as an atomic bomb
but it doesn't have to actually produce
that effect and there are plenty of
things that don't even
you know do that with their
anti-particle neutrons uh anti-neutrinos
and neutrinos don't really interact um
that we know of
uh dark matter poppy does not either but
uh i'm saying
uh there's no real need for neutral
matter in that kind of context because
it's kind of like a positive negative
but
maybe there's something like that out
there we don't know about here too
parkour zoo here's a question that
you're going to enjoy
from worst and thank you wursten for
your 20 pound uh super chat
isaac what are your thoughts on eclectic
vehicles and a
i think mean electric electric vehicles
and ai auto driving
i like eclectic vehicles too i know
i like electric vehicles i tend to think
that they got pushed a little bit too
hard early on when they weren't really
up to snuff yet
and it's made a lot of people very
pessimistic on them as a result you know
you try to stuff something now people's
throat
they are going to be permanently not
fond of it um
but electric vehicles are starting to
kind of make that that transition into
generally economical
uh they probably can get your economy at
scale um
you know in the next decade where they'd
be genuinely competitive without subsidy
that's hard to say um battery is the big
one on that one too of course
i like them as a nice combination to go
with nuclear power
and solar power combinations but really
that's more about getting the right
batteries getting better solar panels
and convincing people that nuclear power
is good
which i think we also have some episodes
coming up on yes we do embracing nuclear
power august 5th episode
and a future thorium episode which is
september 2nd at the schedule on the
right
um and i know we up on the screen we
show the next month's episodes but we
usually are planned out more in advance
like i think the schedule right now goes
to
september 23rd spaceports
so quite a few episodes coming out josie
george wants to know
about the dyson sphere if we wanted to
live on them how would we obtain the
atmosphere
you can't well i shouldn't say you can't
uh you could potentially build dyson
spheres with anti-gravity technology if
you had
artificial gravity technology but the
classic dyson shell image that people
get
and that's why we saw these tone dyson
swarm and sad just indicate a lot of
artificial habitats floating around a
stall
um there was no gravity inside a
spherical shell
if you add up all the various points of
gravity inside a spherical shell
uh like a hollow earth inside there
whether you're one foot away from the
edge or in the center there is
zero gravity so if you've got an
atmosphere inside there it's going to
fall into the sun because the sun in the
middle is still pointing towards you
but you will still be able to breathe
because you'll also fall in with the
atmosphere to the sun
and some months later you would land in
the sun
that that that sounds exciting yeah
land in the sun and burned your grass
bone through a crisp yes yeah okay
on that lovely note we had a clarifying
question from sam jones on the string
theory concept he said if that
if string theory did turn out to be true
could the idea that gravity leaks
across fatal dimensions explain dark
matter
dark energy is usually the thing that
they think of as being connected to
rather than dark matter
we tend to think that dark matter is
just a type of matter that is fairly
non-interactive
and again there's a lot of matter we
already have there's nothing you know
after neutrinos
um dark matter only has been is
non-interactive with neutrinos and just
heavier like
most particles most particles are
actually heavier than atoms that we have
most particle types like tau
tower neutrinos and side bottom and top
quarks are both heavier than uh
than whole atoms um but
uh the leakage thing is more the dark
energy concept gravity is insanely
weaker than the other
three physical forces electro weak
strong nuclear um
they are you know not as strong as each
other there's a difference of you know
 of magnitude between them but
galleries are trillion trillion trillion
times weaker
so the assumption is you and only
positive the assumption is often that it
is connected to the flow of time
that gravity is only positive in the
direction of time flowing forward
or that it leaks between universes as in
string theory those are
very good theories i don't really like
to
popularize them though because again
there's no evidence
that they're true and i feel like when
we popularize that a lot it didn't give
people the impression that that's been
worked out and then
ten years later someone kills the theory
and everyone's ahaha you've proven this
thing gone once again
and it gives people the impression that
physics is one of those fears that
constantly disproves itself
when in point of fact i can't remember
whatever having done so even once
so uh we'll take one more question
before we go to break
oh i i had like four oh okay well we can
wrap the father and we're going to
speak those in we've got quite a few
coming in so um
silver comic what do you consider to be
some low-hanging fruit in trying to
investigate the fermi paradox that we're
not currently pursuing
uh looking for atmospheric soil intros
probably a high levels oxygen would be
the easiest one
okay um also we have a super chat from
eric johansson thank you for your
donation
would a united world government even
just a loose confederation
be beneficial for humanity to expand
into space
probably less than people would expect
um you know
neither the soviet union or the united
states actually needed the unified
government to get to the moon
yeah and and it might have discouraged
them from
pursuing it as rapidly yeah i think it
was being quite useful in many ways to
have a unified government or the exact
opposite but the key is i don't expect
us to
really have one until maybe centuries
down the middle we call us millions of
other plans or something
in which case i like to think we could
call it a nice space so probably could
do it without a unified government
otherwise ain't gonna get done probably
um lucas spren asks if you agree
that it doesn't bode well how many
people prac oh
hold on maybe i didn't read this
question um
sorry about that i think i'm going to
skip that one and
move on to the last one here with daryn
jones we are a species
we as a species are just about ready to
start expanding into space again
are we on the verge of greatness or
conflict we are always on the verge of
greatness and conflict
and except for when we are completely
over the edge into both of those things
we are we always a species that kind of
thrives on a bit of chaos but
that's that's yeah that's how it works
with us um
i think we're always on the edge of of
self-destruction and uh you know
we are at the same time both incredibly
vile
and noble all those one of the things
we're a great dichotomy and all that
though let's go to break
that's gonna say i think so we will be
on break for a few minutes and it's a
great time to get a drink and a snack
and some more questions into our
moderators
for those of you who tuned into last
month's livestream where we were doing
our first one at the new studio and the
audio was out for the first couple of
minutes
then the camera failed twice thanks for
joining us again this month
and fingers crossed we were having less
technical difficulties
but when the first camera failure
happened i'd been in the middle of
discussing how black holes distort
space-time
and i thought i'd continue and finish
that while we're on break the first
thing to understand is that black holes
are tiny and have no special gravity
going on
turning a star into a black hole does
not result in its plants getting sucked
in
or even making it dangerous to be nearby
it's regular gravity and doesn't start
producing its weirder effects
until you are considerably closer to it
there would already have been lethal
close to the old star
pre-black hole whenever you put matter
or energy into place
it draws things towards it and makes it
a bit harder to get away the nearer you
pass
as it would leach your velocity and if
you increase that enough the velocity
would advise the speed of light
or higher one key notion there the event
horizon of a black hole
is that place where it reaches light
speed but it doesn't stop right after
that
go a few meters lower and the escape
velocity is now even higher
now first ten know of the event horizon
and know that time slows near a black
hole and eventually freezes
but this is not specifically at the
event horizon except to an external
viewer
since what they would see would be you
falling into that hole then freezing
around and disappearing
as no photons bouncing off you are
scheming to reach them anymore
this frozen image is going to redshift
away though growing weaker
as an ultra slow motion capture the last
few handful of photons
to escape here as you fell and as each
microsecond pass in that last bit of
time
each new set of photons has to work
harder and get more redshifted as they
escape
until they finally cancel anymore and
each takes longer to claw its way out to
the observer
so all this in terms of space-time
phrasing is when you see time seem to
stop for the person falling in
indeed if you left right after them
right before that so you were falling
toward the black hole yourself
you see them longer than someone else
stationary to that black hole would
because that escape velocity of the
photons is just a blanket approximation
for the outside galaxy
all motion is relative and you can get
photons from that person falling in
longer if you're flying in behind them
and in reverse if you're flying away
from a black hole its event horizon
would be bigger to you
the faster you were going indeed if
you're falling into one you would never
see that event horizon get reached
because it will run away from you
what we mean by event horizon is when
you can no longer see events on the
other side of it occurring but when
talking about black holes around the
galaxy we discussed the size of event
horizon in terms of just where most
folks in the galaxy would see them
or often out at an infinite distance for
the sake of calculation
so your time dilation is dependent on
the observer but you can approximate
that
very loosely by calculating how fast you
have to go to reach that observer and
rendezvous with them
or alternatively to calculate the
potential energy needed to reach them
convert that into kinetic energy then
into speed and jam it into the event's
formula
one divided by the square root of one
minus to square the velocity as a
fraction of light speed
to find out how much slower time should
be going critically though
it's only when we start talking about
building shell worlds around super
massive black holes
what we call a birch planet or when we
contemplate building some sort of raft
of computers and virtual worlds in close
orbit of a black hole
that time slows any degree that would be
relevant to a society
needless to say that's still an abridged
explanation but hopefully a bit clearer
than the one given last time when the
answer was on the fly with technical
problems going on
and now back to our hopefully
glitch-free second half of the show
and we're back so you're ready for that
question that we left on the break with
lucas sprint
it says do you agree it doesn't bode
well how many people practically worship
elon musk
and doesn't question whether he is sole
designer on spacex
or not he never said he was but some
people think he is in fact that's a
leading question um
elon musk for a lot of people is a love
or hate figure i
think very well of him uh but i think of
him the same way i think i like tesla
edison there's a lot of
there's well i want to say
self-promotion they're good at promoting
their work
and that's a very positive trait to
having a corporation that's trying to
get people to invest
you know untoward billions into
something that has um
you know not got a proven track record
of return um so i'm very impressed with
his ability to do that
i don't think he's ever tried to claim
credit for anybody's work uh even by
a mission though he's he's the front man
for that organization but
the thing to keep in mind is we still
have a lot of inventions most inventions
though done by single people but a lot
of the big projects
you know it's always the uh uh you know
john smith
joe doe and at all and always like
a thousand hard-working people who just
didn't make the top of that paper
and uh you know big companies like that
that can happen too but
i think of elon musk as a good guy but
just another person i don't i don't
really get my people worship or loathe
him he's a guy who gets a lot of work
done for what we do and he employs a lot
of good people
roger m says don't you think that we
should focus
in panspermia of life through the solar
system
rather than finding life in dead planets
um well i mean my muslim understanding
that a little bit panspermia is the idea
that life came from
earth um to well actually i shouldn't
say um awful specifically
the idea is that some source of life has
promulgated the entire
universe prior to galaxy or regions uh
with a common core as opposed to a space
colonization of a technological nature
we did do an episode on panspermia too
where we looked at the odds on that
but until we've actually had a chance to
really
dig into some of these plants and we've
never been to another planet with an
actual resource team yet
i think it's way too soon to be talking
about the probabilities of life on any
of them
you know sci-fi by alan crawley thank
you for your 20
super chat he says you do a brilliant
job of presenting the science of
futurism
what about the political dimensions of
moving into space and how do things like
the artemis accords move us forward into
space
um again we are doing that geopolitics
episode with the radio from what i've
uh would have outhist uh shortly uh in
july and he'll be kind of trying to look
into that too but
the thing is you know trying to guess
who's gonna win
the next election tom is tricky enough
without trying to throw in space that
too
i think folks sometimes spend a little
bit too much time trying to predict the
political situation
um and a lot of times it's kind of wish
fulfillment it's like with aliens it was
like
these aliens who are much more noble
than us and would do these
much more enlightened things and we all
done basically realized that these
aliens agree with them on everything
and that's they're just assuming that
they're enlightened because of that or
that's what enlightened ones would act
like
the history of our award has been one of
constant turmoil with changing political
and ideological systems
i can't imagine that uh spreading out
over a galaxy
or even just a solar system would
suddenly make us more homogenous
but that's my opinion we have a lot of
government questions today paul leake
the second wants to know how do you feel
about the saying
one man's utopia is another man's
dystopia and how it relates to unified
governments and the ethics of
implementation
oh yeah i think that's i think that's
unambitious one man's utopia can also be
his dystopia i should think
um i you know again
what a lot of us would like to see is
not what others would like to see
uh it depends on what your core
assumption is for how life should work
out
and you know what is the core basis for
your morality and things like that
i'd say the political questions actually
better directed my wife the politician
rather than me
but um yeah i will not
answer questions that would you know
speak to basically advantage a certain
political situation of or position
that's not what this show's about
i have those same as everybody else i
just you know we try to keep the show
away from that and not potential neutral
i have these opinions
uh but rather i just try to keep my own
opinions out of it too
um and so be a little careful some of
the
questions just because on ladies i would
not answer them generally speaking
so um we have a super chat of 25
uh actually i'm not familiar with hrk
from
pantagana and
she is saying why do you think so many
people use the word
fold when they mean times a fold is
double
so a 100 i'm sorry 1 000 fold increase
is 2 to the one thousand times
not one thousand times um that's
actually a good question i
i tend to be one of the relatively few
people who uses phrases like ten fold or
thousand forward in casual conversation
but uh
yeah they would be if we were thinking
in that context to the 10th power is
1024 right and uh a thousand four to be
two to one thousands power which should
be something like ten to thirty three
that's what 10 to 133 something like
that
doesn't matter ten to three hundred
thirty thirty whichever
you're guessing yeah i am kind of
guessing at this point
that is not it would be it would be like
ten to three hundred thirty three
um but uh
i don't know the actual basis for that
expression it might actually mean times
i you know
that would be an etymology question i
couldn't i thought it was a good
question as far as
use of the word appropriately but it
also begs the question
you know when you use a word a certain
way
so frequently does it change the under
underlying meaning from what it
originally was
to common usage a lot of time the
original meaning is is not even what the
original
you know what's required too because it
was in common usage for like a century
if we
got around to writing now what it meant
kevin berg says
have you noticed the doomsday argument
is moot because we are such a young race
now i think the doomsday argument is a
probabilistic
we did an episode on it way way back
like season one or two
it's like somewhere in the first 20
episodes i think um
and i've always meant to actually redo
the episode on that just to explain
that the wow that works through a little
bit but it's an example of a
probabilistic argument in the anthropic
principle and it's one of our
three big ones that we use to
demonstrate the anthropic principle um
and uh the other two being fine-tuned
universe you know is this universe
uniquely
suited for life and the simulation
hypothesis is this is this useful is
real
um but the concept there is that in
science we have two principal ways and
in day-to-day life we have two principal
ways that we
deal with eight total ignorance right uh
we can assume that
whatever we encounter is a mediocre
example the component can or mediocrity
principle approach
or we can assume that all seeing an
object is
not random the anthro self-oriented
uh principle and uh that would be
something like i look around i see 10
other people wearing jersey and i'm
wearing a jersey too
uh we should not assume that most people
wear jerseys we should assume that i'm
seeing those people because i'm a team
member of theirs who just got knocked on
the head
the key about all those things like the
doomsday principle
sorry doomsday argument sim hop and uh
fine tuning is not
so much the answer is that these are
examples we can use where it's
impossible to get more information from
a practical standpoint
and so it allows us to actually ask
these questions about how the best way
to ask questions in total ignorance is
and that's where that comes in but maybe
we should do the doomsday argument
episode again though because there's a
fun topic
gemmar100 also thank you for your super
chat
he says i'm a big fan my question is
when we say that a black dwarf could one
day turn into iron
do we literally mean a ball of solid
metal that you could walk on
you wouldn't want to walk on it probably
you might burn your feet
well it would be cold by then to be fair
the the iron star phase takes place
so long down the road after something
has gotten to be a black dwarf
um you got to keep in mind the black
dwarf still has about half the mass
you know half a solar mass and now it's
condensed into iron
um and when it gets that point you can
start transitioning a black hole but
just anything of that size when it's
down to an earth size and cool down
the gravity on that's enough to shatter
you completely just from the
difference in force from your feet to
your head you're getting near to the
spiritification point of a black hole at
that point so
i just saw a chat somebody says you're
building a spaceship in the backyard
they must have seen my raspberry bed
[Laughter]
it's visible from the freeway
dr awesome what is the unit in cigna
on the mug in the background i think
they're looking at your uh
sfi this one yes that says uh
if brute force isn't working you aren't
using enough of it it's one of our
merchandise cups i think there's
actually a link for them in the episode
description
so you can get them on the website light
thank you for your super chat and he
says hi
isaac do you think that lunar
colonization could be profitable today
and if not what are the biggest
obstacles that need to be overcome first
other mugs uh you know what was it again
colonization neutral colonization is
possible today yeah
profitable today not just possible
profitable
that's the oh wow um you know
since i am not a billionaire i tend to
be careful throwing around terms like
profitable and what would be uh since if
i knew these like that i presumably
would be a billionaire um
or or you would not be a billionaire
because you would have spent the money
on
hell that's that's true yeah i think um
i don't know you know could you do one
now yes we could absolutely do a moon
base now we could even do a minimum
colony now
could we make it profitable i don't see
how it could be
profitable in a classic sense of the
stage more
sort of like early investments uh you
buy stock in it and essentially now it
pays off really well
or you can sell it for increasingly
large amounts down the road it seems
like
if your asteroid or comet mining would
suddenly take a century to get back you
might be able to
say hey we can prove we have this thing
it's coming back towards earth and
arrive here our century from now
and sell for 100 per unit i'm going to
sell my share right now for 10 bucks
per unit you know so that's an option
maybe
future commodities forecasting kevin
farquaad says
isaac first time here i love your live
stream
apologies for the interruption i just
wanted to say i'm a huge fan
thank you so much for all of your work i
love all of your content
again thank you so much well you're
welcome and that was a great
interruption thank you very much
sanno bell asks santa bello says are
there
any ways that we could have a
shape-shifting human
yes for a given value of human um
you know one of the first times i heard
it really put into semi-scientific terms
was in
frank hobart's sequel to the original
dude novel doing messiah
with the benny talaksu and i can't what
they are shape-shifters are called
um but they are mules but i can't move
the car anyway they have shapeshift was
there where they were also some very
intensive muscle control and
and you know can move their joints
things like that gets very comfy all but
probably the one not a very good movie
but probably a good example for this was
the
uh the tomato sequel that had doctor who
in it
uh as skynet um where john connor
uh because they wanted to destroy the
franchise had been turned into a machine
composed of tiny little machines instead
of a big robot
so he basically was walking around you
know a trillion little machines like
cells
that could assemble into a human form um
and that would be a really good example
of how you would do that probably not by
having single machines that were all
identical you know any more than the
body
rehab is so just the idea that you could
have a cohesive force between those
allows you to rearrange them
sounds like this person might have been
watching your panel discussion yesterday
on uh
on the idsc international space
international space development
conference yes
so uh civil engineering with tonya laird
hi isaac
could a black hole farming civilization
last indefinitely
by dumping their waste heat back into
their black hole
we were just discussing waste dates
from that conversation that was one of
our original um
for contest we missed it the
international space development
conference
that got cancelled last year uh went on
this year virtually
and that was the last few days going on
there and i showed up as a palace
to accept the award and this year the
what i got which is seeing the
background of fail
i have the camera on sarah again you're
on me
i should laugh the one back there in the
corridor that's that's the award from
them from last year
um but uh congratulations to phil plate
by the way for having won it this year
um it's black holes heat loss and
i get distracted today i think it's
because it's a sunday i i
should go out play in the garden after
this but
uh you could potentially dump heat down
a black hole but we do not really know
how the
thermodynamics of black holes works
there is a tendency to assume
that you can use black holes to cheat
thermodynamics when in point of fact all
we know for sure is that we can't say
for sure that you can't uh we haven't
ruled out that black holes follow the
loss of thermodynamics yet or some close
version of them
and until we do there is a possibility
you could dump heat down to one
without you know and then pull it back
out as an entropy free source but
i tend to be a little bit dubious about
that or using it as a stealth tech of
being able to hide your civilization
from
it but here's the big one you would
probably be able to find some way to
dump some in you'd still have some
leaking out that just got
missed and if you're a civilization that
can actually do that
you gotta think about kind of
civilization that you'd be trying to
hide yourself from that be a threat
if you've mastered black hole technology
and heat farming like that
uh they better be some multi-galactic
empire or you're gonna corpse stomp them
so
you're not really all that worried about
hiding a little bit of trails and they
could see those tiny little bits anyway
so
okay i think this is a follow-up
question from worsted from earlier and
thank you again for your
donation worst and he says your thoughts
on
ai in autopilot or auto drive in
vehicles now i know that you're looking
forward to
when i can get that to drive to columbus
but
my usual notion is that uh
you know it's not about do i trust the
computer to drive better than i do
is do i trust the computer drive better
than you do the answer is yes
you drive pretty good uh i will
acknowledge that but i mean i actually
trust the computer drive better than me
because i have zoned out before i have
had you know
in god knows how many hundred thousands
of miles driving over
24 or five years of driving i've had
times where i've zoned out on wisconsin
accents and i've gone off the road once
twice too you know it's it's
the computer's not going to get tired
like that and that's the advantage of it
and we're not going to put something at
that in place until it's been really
tested you know it's going to be safer
than the average driver by an order of
magnitude for wherever that actually hit
the road
do you think it would like allow you to
switch back and forth so if you're
driving
a short trip and you want to drive you
can and if you're driving a long trip
and you want to take a nap that that's
an option
it will be customizable to what people
want to be but the place where it's
likely to leak in
first is going to be on the freight side
of things where it's just straight drive
slow and the other is going to be where
it catches you you start to go off the
core
there's already those in place where it
will auto correct for you
that's where it leaks in and you know
most of us want to still have our hands
on the wheels we like to know that if we
start drifting off
you know there's going to be that rumble
strip on the side that lets us be awake
well in this case we like to know the
car is going to get the wheel back on
the road
um that's kind of where that's probably
going to go first but yeah i think you
absolutely want to be seeing computers
more heavily used in cars we've got
autopilot on airplanes for a long time
we still have pilots
uh but at the same time do we really
need to have them on everything
probably not so they'll definitely get
into there i'd like them
james negari says why aren't people
pursuing cold
fusion
um because fusion fundamentally
is best done at very high temperatures
that's that's kind of the issue there
high pressures and temperatures where
it's most easily done if we had a good
theoretical model for how you could
actually achieve cold fusion then we'd
be throwing people out left and right
and it's not just there have been a lot
of scams on court fusion that have come
out
uh there's also been a lot of real
research down that direction too they're
all having scams with every other type
of power source
chord fusion has a bad rap but part of
that comes from the fact that there's no
known
theory or theoretical basis for you to
not do it as a as a scam so
when someone develops a good theory that
isn't scammy then it will probably get a
better reputation
jamal enusa says what are some
recommended readings for someone
interested in futurism at a beginner
level please
for futurism specifically you know level
um
i mean you know rate crossbow uh voter
revenge those are good places to kind of
start off on some of the thoughts with
it and i wouldn't say that really
i'm not sure if there is a beginner
level of it but those are probably the
most cited ones
anything by nick bostrom um you know
he's
he's a philosopher more than a futurist
but uh a lot of his works on things is
exactly kind of
thinking where you're at for that to
kind of move that direction i cannot
name the fellow who runs less wrong
elizor udowski i think maybe i'm
probably mispronouncing that
um there a lot of the basic features and
thoughts that you see there i don't
know sandbox those are good ones too um
but book wise i don't know that i really
say there's any book i'd specifically
recommend
if i write one i'll recommend that one
though how about your favorite science
fiction movie
favorite science fiction movie is always
blade runner that the original um that's
that's always my number one
and uh follow shortly by the david lynch
version of dune
james thompson green wants to know how
about a future episode on quote
clearing a kessler syndrome in other
words the worst case has happened
how short of waiting a long time could
the orbit be cleared
um how short could be cleared
an hour flight time for a nuclear bomb
to go up there and everything into that
older path to be vaporized pretty much
about an hour if you're willing to shoot
nukes off in you know
and low orbit which it depends on how
badly do you want to get off that planet
and keep in mind you can set kessler
cinderella off on some planet that has
no atmosphere or ecology on it too
so guadam vinold says hi isaac what do
you think will happen
after the theory of everything what will
be the major implications
and what will be the new frontier of
science and research research
i was ranting about strength theory a
little bit earlier um this is another
thing happens with the theory of
everything
it would be neat to have a theory of
everything a grand unified theory that
connects gravity up with you know
um but there is a tendency to assume
that this must be true because we would
like to be true and because we found out
the strong force was connected to the
weak force and
that to electromagnetism and that
electricity and magnesium are connected
so gravity must be connected
uh even though it has nothing at all
like those on the fact that operates in
a three-dimensional universe in that
inverse square way
um it there may be a grand unified
theory but we should not take it as a
given that there is and that's what i
kind of mean when i say things like how
a given theorist
or you know group of theorists or the
popular media is kind of
taking a theory that has no real
evidence to back it up per se and
pushing it as
something that almost certainly is true
in the way the public absorbs it
you know i would love to have a grand
unified theory i tend to towards
assuming there will be one
but don't take that as a given if you
approach it from the assumption that
there is one
you could end up getting blind to the
autonomy so they have nothing to do with
each other they're right angles to each
other you know
nafilbata nation says hi isaac what do
you think the first reactions to an
undeniable detection of an alien
civilization will be
uh wtf omg
probably there's a faster type in yeah
parceling tao thank you for your super
chat at five dollars
he says hi great people what's the
biggest bang we can theoretically
produce
is a well-timed pinrose process on all
available black holes the biggest bang
you know there's the idea that you could
connect all the various black holes and
universe together simultaneously through
whatever was allegedly theoretically
connecting them and then set them off to
detonate in some fashion um
i think the biggest bank could ever set
off in one shot would probably be the
big bang
um although that's not really the right
way to look at that explosion
um i think your biggest probably are the
ones we always see naturally coin like
quasars or
um black hole mortals so probably your
biggest energy release one you could
possibly have happen would be
two galactic core black hole modules uh
but you should see a lot of those
happening in about
the one quadrillion year range i guess
is when you see a lot of those happening
michael tape says is it your opinion
that life exists under the ice of europa
and what might be the most expedient
method of finding signs of this life
expedient expedient you know like a
nuclear bomb
yeah for the fine life wouldn't that
destroy it
i was trying to find uses for nuclear
bombs that are peaceful um
we did a test i it was always a bit of a
funny one uh it was
the day after president obama got
nominated for the peace prize was also
the
like the headline article was nasa nukes
moon
oh that's the next question um but we we
did a uh
an impact on the moon to cause dust you
know to shoot up in the uh
not atmosphere but low orbit of the moon
and then we could spectrophory analyze
that dust
you could theoretically ram something
into europa uh
that managed to penetrate that hill or
10 kilometers deep or whatever it is to
get the ice there down the water
and have the water spray up and analyze
that for life forms that came up
which is a good thing to use like a bass
drive or uh you know
a uh rod from god or a nuke four but
probably your best way to do it if i was
going to just throw one together would
be
a large radio thermogenic otg
a large radio thermal isotope generator
on the end of a lawn fiber optic cable
that had good tensile strength they used
that melt down the ice
all the way down 10 kilometers and then
have sensors on the back end of that
and of course you want to make sure
that's well shielded otherwise all your
new life forms will be getting
encountered by that rtg
powered probe would be getting
sterilized by that radioactive
probe but you know it's doable that's
how you melt down to the eyes i think
not intimidated asks what would the
consequences be of taking mass
off the moon um i think the question
that tends to come up is if we if we
took
mass off the moon in large quantities
and and you have to set up a
lot of quantities that it would somehow
change the orbit of the earth or the
moon or things like that and
the trick to remember is that
we have angular momentum thing five for
instance if you are taking stuff off the
moon
when you left the moon you were pushing
against the moon in a different
direction we did that
so you know like when you add mass the
moon you already
you don't slow the orbit of a planet or
moon down by adding mass to it in
general because the stuff you added to
it was already going at that speed when
you injected it
um but you could if you were willing to
extract the equivalent of the entire
earth crust from the moon that could
have a significant impact on on the
overall
mass distribution of the earth moon
system to cause some orbital changes but
i you'd have to run through the
calculations on them and they'd be very
specific to each case
kevin dunn says isaac when do you think
we will get to building a giant
telescope on the far
side of the moon that would be something
i would hope to see this century
uh you know especially when those big
xena telescopes uh just because i think
that's cool to have one that's made out
of liquid metal
um but uh
that should be i'd say we probably have
probes or telescopes decent-sized ones
on the dark side of the moon just fall
outside the moon i see as
dark in terms of noise probably in the
next couple decades to be honest it's
it's so advantageous to
to land one there and if you put hubble
up you can hop up and put on inside the
moon
that's the idea michael linkswinski said
thank you for your 20 super chat and he
says sup man
keep up the good work loving the show
will do man
thank you k.w matterhorn hey isaac what
are your thoughts on lancaster labs
quench gun they say they could
eventually scale
payload to orbit costs down to 50 bucks
a kilo
that would be honest when they pulled it
off you know we have a lot of things
that could potentially drop it down to
under 100 a kilo i like lost room loops
as my my preferred one for that
along with older rings as their windows
but those are much further down the road
fuel is not really the big cost and that
stuff it's the reusability angle and a
lot of launch costs and i think that's
hard to really calculate because a lot
of that relies on the economy of scale
too
i think we have time for a few more
questions that we call quits all right
um vowel or dark
excuse me if i mispronounce that one
veildarg
says does isaac see a future where these
unprovable or disprovable theories like
multiverse simulation etc turn into
full-blown
science-centric religions yes
well that was easy next question
i mean that could happen very easily did
you want to expound on that um
you know physics kind of broke off from
math toward the end of the 19th century
and the early 20th century
because it was kind of the idea on the
one hand that you want to be
a lot more actual experimental proof of
ideas than just what worked on people
at the same time there was an awful lot
of you know mysticism
and woohoo on on the physicists of the
late 19th century too
and uh so that's uh you know you look at
that period in time had a lot of that
too like egyptology especially took off
that period
um there was a lot of tendency of
various scientific theories that
quantum mysticism is its whole religion
already so
yes the videographer experience says
isaac do you think humanity will
make it become multi-planetary or
multi-habitat
in time to survive potentially a billion
years or so
a billion years a very long time to to
really have anything that we might
qualify as humanity start kicking around
at that point
i would think that if we were still
around anything that was really
recognizably us that would probably be
uh not a great sign for us either
because we've
been stagnant but at the same time yeah
i think we will um
you know kylo is kind of like asking you
know
wouldn't amoeba last that long i think
we i think we'd be around still in some
fashion or something that we made that
could call ourself a child of always be
around
q 9073 says what do you think of the
physics of multiple time dimensions
i can't seem to find much on the topic
and i feel like it might be another form
of multiverse travel if they exist
and i'll leave that scripture so we've
had so many people mentioning things
that were in the
script i just finished writing like last
week what day is that one coming out
that one's coming out on august 26th
edge of the universe
on the edge of their seats for the
summer
um multiple time dimensions is is every
bit as an option same as multiple
physical dimensions
a lot of other ones too i mean sometimes
the basis for things like you know
magnetism and electricity is to assume
there's another dimension that they
operate in
and that's the cosmos there's an up down
that's compactified you know it's uh
there's room for other dementia side
space and time there's room for multiple
time dimensions too
okay uh uh another question here from
albert jackson
what form do you think the internet and
social media will take in the future
especially with technology such as bcis
and vr
um predicting the internet and that
context is really hard the internet's
main purpose is to transmit information
around and that's why it's mostly used
for showing cats and their love of
cheeseburgers
and you know i think with bci's
it gets a lot easier to do a lot of
stuff smoothly like when i was a kid
everything was about how there was gonna
be video telephones sometimes soon video
telephones and and the long distance
rates would go down a bit too
uh for those of you who remember when
there was such thing as long distance
phone calls and collect calls
um but then video phone calls really
didn't take off in favor of text
messaging instead an example of how you
don't always want more bandwidth
but i think that you probably would
actually start seeing a lot more of that
like
seamless you know communication where if
you were like talking to someone i felt
like they were living the same
with them possibly even emulated and
augmented reality i think that's
probably one of the areas that would go
everything else so hard to predict
though
all right here's the last question for
today to end on a fun note
if jeff bezos mystery passenger decides
to give their ticket to you
would you go no i was going to say is
this the mystery passenger offering it
and how do they know you're not the
mystery passenger already
i i am a very cautious person and i am
not terribly fond of flying
um i uh i would love to see space one
day when it was
already so mundane it was like going to
disney or whatever put it that way i
encourage other people to go but i
myself want to know it's guaranteed to
get back i might take your ticket for
you that while you'd be welcome to
tickets uh
insurance policy hey i did see one from
france cadet by the end too if we
finish out what is the right way to
imagine the big bang as i was just
saying i feel like i like that script
that is another one of the ones so the
edge of the universe will be discussing
for that
and uh from weston asking when you're
trying to go to sleep what you want
about lately
uh usually i'm listening to an audiobook
on a little headset when i go to sleep
and of late i've been listening to
kyphus kane here of the imperium
uh from the mohamed 40k level so that
that that's what i've been listening to
of late and why i was thinking about
when i went to bed
i guess we'll go ahead and sign off the
hero for the day
thank you everyone for joining us and
what a surprisingly glitch-free uh day
it's been
i hope you all enjoy the rest of sunday
and uh have a good one
thank you to everybody for their super
chats we had a lot of super chats today
we really appreciate it yes my wife is
the coolest one
thank you everybody for your support the
channel and we will see you on thursday
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook
reddit discord or our website
isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
thursday
you
