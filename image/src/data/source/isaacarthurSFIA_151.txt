Deciphering Alien Codes
As we search for extraterrestrial intelligences
out in the cosmos, one common question is
if we could even recognize their signal or
ever hope to decode their language.
Folks often point to tons of untranslated
ancient tablets as evidence.
If we can’t decipher things written by members
of our own species, what chance would we have
with some aliens from an entirely different
evolutionary origin?
You might have seen recent articles about
AI translating those old tablets with relative
ease and speed.
At its core this was never a problem of those
languages being alien, merely us have so few
examples to work with.
Fundamentally language is about conveying
concepts to others, and some will be universal,
like math and physics concepts, and can serve
as a Rosetta stone with sufficient examples,
which we explored in greater depth in our
Alien Languages and Cryptic Aliens episodes.
It wouldn’t be fast or easy, but if Aliens
are out there, we should be able to talk to
them.
