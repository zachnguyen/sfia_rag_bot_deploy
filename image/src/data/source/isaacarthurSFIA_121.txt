The big news out for today was the unveiling
of a pair of mummified hybrid aliens to the
Mexican Congress alleged containing human
DNA and 30% unknown DNA, discovered in Peru
back in 2017, and dating to roughly a thousand
years ago.
We have the usual rush to claim the truth
has been found and aliens are here, and the
similar kneejerk response to say its BS, which
it probably is.
As usual a polite and cautious skepticism
is the best approach, until proper third-party
analysis can be done, but for everyone jamming
my inbox this morning to ask, no I don’t
think this aliens.
One of the folks involved has credibility
issues involving alien evidence from the past
too.
Given that we have tons of DNA from that era
and now and nothing in our DNA has really
changed, I’m not sure what these alien hybrids
would indicate if true, possibly second-generation
refugees, and we explored that concept more
in our Alien Refugees episode, and we’ll
look at alien-human hybrids and if they make
sense in Mid-November.
