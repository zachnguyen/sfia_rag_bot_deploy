The Alderson Disk is a popular but impractical
megastructure that seeks to build an enormous
flat planet with a Sun at its center, as an
alternative to a Dyson Sphere.
While such a structure can be built using
active support systems, even if you do build
it, the Sunlight is always coming from the
horizon and will rapidly dim and redden, leaving
a sun-scorched inner ring of the disc and
a dim twilight region rapidly ebbing to frozen
gloom, with only a small habitable belt region.
It will also tend to have the air and water
drift toward the center and require a rim
wall to keep it from falling into the Sun.
Why you would build this is hard to say but
if you really want one large connected sheet
of land and sea, you have the option of placing
huge polar statite mirrors over your Sun to
bounce light to the more distant regions with
shading or angling to create a rotating day
night cycle over the whole disk.

Compendium.
