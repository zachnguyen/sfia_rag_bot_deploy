One of the keys to determining dark energy
and hubble expansion are Type 1a supernovae,
our standard candle for the cosmos.
When a white dwarf absorbing matter from a
binary neighbor reaches a certain mass it
will detonate and normally leave nothing behind,
and this releases a very specific amount and
type of light, which we can calculate distance
from by how bright it appears to us and calculating
based on how bright we know it is.
But we believe a Type 1ax Supernova, which
is a bit weaker, can be caused when a white
dwarf absorbs matter too quickly from a neighbor
and the resulting supernova fizzles.
This may leave behind a remnant, smaller but
temporarily brighter than the white dwarf
that spawned it, a Zombie Star given new life
from the dead star which exploded from robbing
its binary neighbor.
This includes radioactive material, as these
blasts help generate the heavier elements
critical to life forming.
They are still mysterious, and may vary greatly
in size and composition, but one model suggests
roughly 20% of the mass would remain and composed
principally of neon, oxygen, and other heavier
elements.
