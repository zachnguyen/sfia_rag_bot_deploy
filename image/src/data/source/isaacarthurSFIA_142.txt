S016 Could Technology Bring You Back to Life?
August 4, 2023
Medical Technology has revived people who
have stopped breathing or whose heart has
stopped, but could it revive those who are
already brain dead and, if so, for how long?
The answer is likely yes, as we better learn
how our brains operate, but this analogy often
gets stretched to imply recovery could be
done days or even centuries later.
That in this way we could resurrect the ancient
dead, or that a super powerful computer mind
could - which is the source of the Rokoâ€™s
Basilisk Retro-Casual Thought Problem.
By back-calculating the trajectory of particles
decaying or leaving a brain, we could resurrect
that person, by rebuilding that brain, especially
if well-preserved or frozen.
However, even without involving quantum mechanics,
many systems would likely be too chaotic and
complicated to model even with planet-sized
computers, and grow exponentially worse with
every day that passed without proper preservation
efforts.
See our episode Technological Resurrection
for more discussion of the potential methods
and problems.
