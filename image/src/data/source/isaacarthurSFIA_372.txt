good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia
monthly livestream q a we'll get started
in just a moment
but go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window so our
moderators can start relaying those to
me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink
and a snack though we'll take a break
about halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
okay it looks like we are live but we're
having some technical connections
getting set up for those of you who came
at four o'clock we're sorry for the
delay
okay live that it is notifying live now
so
okay so it is we are live now sorry for
layover which gave it a minute to
make sure everything's straightened out
it looks like youtube decided to change
around its entire
uh live streaming system and key on us
uh in the last month
so always glad for those little
technical changes
welcome to fall fall into change
uh cindy can you just confirm real quick
that we've actually got this live
oh i see a picture of you this time yeah
well it looks like the nice prepared
advanced thing is not actually there but
all right okay so let's go ahead and get
started with the questions we'll sort
any problems out in the meantime we need
to break in about half an hour
okay um well we had a few questions from
september that we wanted to address
while people are
adding their questions to the chat so
please be sure to do that
if you want to get your question in on
this live stream and the first question
we're going to answer today is from
nicholas nelson
what do you think of nuclear space
planets
nuclear space planes um we did an
episode on those
i'm sorry planes nuclear space planes
that's why you're looking at me funny
let's rephrase that question what do you
think of nuclear space planes
what happens with people with typos in
the questions well we all talked about
uh nuclear space plants we had to come
one time with uh what was it uh
uh rocket raccoons those would be vacuum
raccoons
uh nuclear space planes we did an
episode on the nuclear option some years
back looking at using them and one thing
we stressed there is that they're
really they're great for interplanetary
stuff they're great for cis lunar travel
but the biggest problem they have when
you deal with them as atmospheric craft
is they do make for good space planes
they do make for an ideal way to get off
the planet cheaper
um though not as much as you might hope
for the nil more advantage you have with
nuclear
and of course the problem though is
you're the big issue that planes are
flimsy planes blow up
flames get shredded and planes full of
radioactive material
that do that while they're traveling can
uh
potentially be spraying it all over the
place now mind you
uh 20 kilograms of fissile material is
not going to lead you know leave a state
that flies over in some kind of disaster
zone but it's not
an ideal scenario and also you have the
option to blow up by the pad which be a
lot more concentrated
and of course that is only for certain
types of nuclear engines there are some
what we call a dirty
uh engine that are actually great for
deep space which is already irradiated
but what you've never
turned on inside an atmosphere that'd be
like a war crime because it basically
shoots radioactive material out the back
so certain types of ones like the
nuclear thermal system
those are safe so as the thing doesn't
actually get destroyed in the past of
flying so
i don't see nuclear space planes really
being much of an option on earth in the
future
okay we have a donation of ten dollars
from the wall
and he says i know you're a fan of the
babaver
series there is a darker version that
dust is putting out
the author published the whole thing on
reddit and one he wants to know if you
have heard of chrysalis
i actually have just a couple of days
ago um i haven't had a chance to watch
more like the first 10 minutes of the
first podcast on it uh it is a very
similar style for those who are familiar
with bible verse by dennis taylor which
uh quick congratulations to him i just
noticed he had the best times uh new
york best times so
new york times bestseller list today or
yesterday
uh with his new book which i actually
was now for reading on
um and uh what's the name of that book
that book series is the bar before
series uh the new book on that one is
oh wow because he changed the title in
the middle of it uh i think it's the
heavens river now but it was the search
for bender originally um
but uh the christmas series i haven't
had a chance to get into it too much but
it is
one of those uh ones where i think
they're trying to look at von neumann
machines from
more of an angle the first bit of the
podcast reminded me a lot of the
original
novel mutual scene from the novel
considered philippis by enan banks it
seemed like it was a little bit darker
but
i had a chance to evaluate the whole
series yet i am looking forward to
listening to it more very good
we have a question today from isaac
bradeau what do you think
is the future of movies what will they
look like during something like a
galactic empire
well i don't know you really have this
year's movie is so much as a key idea
one of the things about um about
space-time lag is that whatever earth
releases
is going to reach those places as brand
new to them they won't know what's
coming out
uh even if it was a century or by time
it reached them a century away
because that light light issue really
does keep everything up to date you're
not waiting on it anymore you're waiting
out of here
uh getting your revenue back or your
ideas or comments back from them if you
release something you know that could
take a while you release a blockbuster
in the scene
we're going to see how it's going to do
across the galaxy be in for a quarter of
a million year wait for all the
information to come back from
those places seeing what they liked or
not which that could be somewhat cost
ineffective
it might be yeah how you'd actually go
about monetizing almost any information
system or cost
that's proprietary across multiple solar
systems
is very hard to say but i suspect that's
an important question to get answered
because
until we've colonized probably several
thousand star systems uh the majority of
population is likely to live in this one
and the majority of
entertainment things like that is likely
to come from the solar system
so and it's important not just a revenue
stream for this system but also
as a way of homogenizing the colonies
that leave so not just off on their own
completely mutating away from our
culture and potentially going hostile
which also means important to turn out
good movies because you don't want to
make them hostile when they see whatever
you send out for this crap
so you recently did an episode on mars
and you have a question from the duroc
are martian salt underground lakes
suitable for life forms
until we've actually had a chance to
analyze them and see if their extent and
their actual composition we really can't
speak to their ability to be
life-bearing um i'm
amusingly since we are not always as
good as we should be about sterilizing
things we send out there
if we do send something out to probe
them directly and it turns out they are
very suitable for life
uh they are likely to rapidly become
full of life assuming they're not
already so
and again anything in the solar system
that is really
frugal and really ideal for life is
quite likely i've already gotten at some
point
even if it was just from some
collisional explosion off earth sending
some very durable and hearty
microorganism to those
to those moons or um planets but we just
don't know until actually there and we
also want to make sure we avoid
jumping the gun on any of these things
in terms of how suitable they are for
life because
we just did that with venus right the
big surprise thing about venus having
phosphine gas
now it looks like that measurement was
wrong and so until we've actually
explored these things in detail and
studied them
they could be as hostile as living in a
jar of rat poison or which is what
phosphine gas is
or they could be a paradise so we just
don't know until we actually get a look
at them directly
ellie void says do you think that the
only way to travel beyond earth
is as cyborgs considering the
limitations of human biology
one of the things i always like to say
about cyborgs and also
in terms of things like genetic
engineering or virtual reality is
we want to be really careful we start
using definitions like what is a human
versus what is a cyborg or what is
real versus what is augmented reality or
virtual reality um i'm wearing glasses
i'm a cyborg what we usually mean by
that is someone who's got a lot more
machine or
um cubed or augmentation than we have
right now but that's a moving goal post
i don't know if you're gonna have anyone
actually just declares themselves to be
a cyborg
um the original term cyborg though
uh wasn't even talking about mechanical
bits it was the term coined for
modifications by drugs or gene therapy
that we might have to do to astronauts
to get them to be able to live on other
worlds we
would have a hard time probably living
as we are on a lot of those planets even
inside pressurized facilities whether or
not you're doing that kind of
modification through some drug therapies
or
through some retrovirus gene engineering
or some sort of
mental or physical augmentation that's
hard to say
but i think the future belongs to
cyborgs only in the sense that i think
that
when you have a very nice handy and
trustworthy adaptation you can add on
like a little overlay to your eyeball
that lets you check your phone and watch
the tv out the corner of your eyes so
you're kicking out a smartphone
you're probably gonna use that and it
just depends on when you decide you're a
cyborg
and i think the answer is that most the
population would never regard themselves
that way
radek marcinko says what do you think of
qualitative classification of
extraterrestrial civilizations instead
of quantitative scheme of
kardashevs um the kardashev scale is
useless for qualifying civilizations we
have two episodes coming up soon though
uh carter scale is basically planet star
galaxy in terms of energy supply stars
vary in intensity by
factors of a billion or more in terms of
brightness so that's not very handy
scale for precision
and all it does is talk about your power
consumption we
have the technology to make a k2
civilization right now if we actually
had space-based infrastructure
and yet when people think about k2
civilization they're thinking some
you know giant galactic sprawling empire
whose capital ward is is long since
developed in some kind of massive dyson
swarm
and that might be how most of them would
be but at the same time
it doesn't tell you anything about that
civilization they might be really
low-tech they might be really high-tech
they might be really populous there
might be a population of one one
matriarchal brain
they might be completely digital they
might be biological they might be made
of silicon we don't know
so any type of classification system
you're going to do for civilization
though
is going to end up with those same kind
of problems you can
do things taxonomically you know but you
can
you can take traits that every
civilization would be expected to have
don't try to use a single trait though
as measurement how much power they have
how many people they have
you'd want to use all the above um our
very first episode of the show
episode zero we had a mega structural
classification system when i brought it
there
and never brought up on the show since
then because it was never really
intended to be something for discussion
it was basically how do you qualify
these things in terms of their size
their overall type rotating versus
artificial gravity or
shell wall for instance and the
population are designed to keep on them
and that's probably the sort of thing
you have in the future is not a single
classification system of
power or population but all of the above
and you just have
different letters assignments etc make
that
johnny wing says i'd love to see you go
over the orion project again
i felt the nuclear option went over it
too briefly
could you think of any way to improve
the nuclear pulse
propulsion idea and make it work um
you know i think the person would
definitely agree with you that we would
cover that way too briefly would be
stuart
um or beyond nova is his usual call sign
online he is the
one of our editors for the show enough
and he's very into nuclear propulsion
as a researcher on it but i think the
issue with
post nuclear propulsion is that you are
basically
using hundreds if not thousands of
nuclear bombs to propel a ship you can
build a ship store you have to handle
that
the question is can you build one
trustworthy enough that you can't let
them have that
uh whereas you could probably do a light
sail system a little bit easier
um nuclear propulsion in space
i wouldn't want to try to do that as
interstellar star drive until we've
actually
started using it locally more in which
case we know a little bit better how to
control it how to use it more
um carefully and then in a very
efficient and uh
safe hopefully safe manner but uh we
probably should look at project orion
again on project daedalus but i think
that for now
we uh we've covered the basic drive
systems as much as i'd like to do in the
immediate near future maybe sometime
next year
thank you madruk zeke says what is the
future of sapience
will we see total self-awareness or will
non-sapient but hyper-intelligent beings
lead the future
it's a really tricky question to
separate sapients out from
intelligence um you know sapience of war
that we try to use nowadays
to distinguish something that's uh like
us as opposed to ascension now we'd say
things like a horse or whale or cat
um essentially usually covers in the
past couple intelligent species like
ourselves too but we always say yeah
a little bit of a dividing line
something like sapiens but you don't
necessarily have to be
sapient to be very intelligent a
computer has no sentience as no sapiens
um i think that sapiens
and and i usually probably use term just
personhood because it kind of removes a
bit of it there
a person is something that recognizes
itself as a person right might be rather
dumb or might be rather smarter um
but that's that personhood that you'll
be worried about if you don't need that
in some machine you're building or
you're incapable of making that then you
don't do it you don't want to just start
making these things
uh having a desire and a will or a
purpose of their own so i think that in
most cases when you're building machines
built to a task
you will not make them sapient uh not
make them a person
uh assuming you even can without having
a really good reason to do so
and there's already plenty of people to
do jobs when you need people so
if you make a super intelligent weather
predictor it doesn't necessarily need to
have personality you know you can you
can hire weathermen to have the
personality when telling you about the
weather
anthony cavallaro says hey isaac fusion
scientist here
have you looked into the spark arc
projects that meet
commonwealth fusion systems it's
familiar
uh mit has been playing around with that
sort of thing that was i'm sorry maybe
it was supposed to say mit
okay all right um i'll see you now just
like i got confused with the polly well
uh there are a lot of prototype fusion
systems in place
um i haven't seen one recently that was
done by a uh a
school kid for a high school experiment
or middle school or science project
um and it does get hard to track which
ones are developing to which degree
i was friends arizona state who were
playing around with system for it too
and i can't say that i'm terribly
familiar with spock so we might have to
bypass that one for now we'll get into
it later
sorry um we have received a 10
donation from protracted people's
pandemic thank you
and they want to know the thoughts on
the likelihood of space travel
when the alternative of hooking people
into a computer matrix is material
materially cheaper and provides similar
if not equal
immaterial benefit is the great filter
just vr
no definitely not it's it's a very
common suggestion but it's actually
probably one of the worst ways to solve
the following paradox
um here is a critical notion um
if you want a computer to run yourself
on or to run millions of other people on
you need material and energy to build
and run it uh this solar system contains
less than a trillionth of the galaxy's
material and energy
if you want to have more of that and you
presumably do then you would like to
harvest it in some way whether you're
bringing it back or see up new places
elsewhere
doesn't really matter you know you're
talking about digital existences
you can put a machine script around each
individual system or build your
something like a birch world
uh as just your big power supply for the
whole thing that raised the question of
how you actually go out there and
explore it
if you can make a virtual reality
program where the people are engaging
enough the virtual characters seem real
enough they don't have to be people yeah
just real enough that you can actually
say
hello to them have a conversation and
feel like it's something you want to
spend your time in
if you can create an artificial reality
where the characters in it are good
enough
to make people want to abandon normal
reality in big numbers
then you already have enough computer
power enough processing power enough
software capability
to build an artificial probe that can go
ahead and make copies of itself
to basically go out there and do the von
neumann replicator thing
so you already have the technology to
colonize the galaxy or
scavenge it for resource to bring home
and colonize heavier back here
before you actually have a virtual
reality like that and i'd say well
they don't want to go colonize the
galaxy the critical thing about a
self-replicating machine that's spawning
through its own work is you only ever
have to build
one of them um and so all it requires is
that at least one
scientist uh an engineering team have
decided to actually build the thing
before
every last human decided to jump into vr
uh and that's it so in that regard it
doesn't make for a very good foamy
paradox
solution anyway um same for
miniaturization people say well if we go
digital
we don't need as much energy to support
each individual person as much raw
materials
well that's great but whenever you're
talking about exponential growth or a
finite number
wait a few generations and suddenly
you've hit that peak again
things like miniaturization or
digitalization only push it back
maybe a dozen or a hundred generations
at most which is no time at all on the
galactic stage
talking a few centuries a few thousand
years maybe
and that's iffy too because if you're in
a digital civilization where everyone's
thinking faster
experiencing life faster than they're
probably having generations fast or too
so basically miniaturization and virtual
reality they just don't locus fully
paradox solutions
we have a question from zachariah
palmisano thank you for that 10
contribution zachariah and he says hi
isaac
i just finished the chronology of
episodes and still have a question
does a black hole mass have an effect on
its life from our perspective
due to the rules of special relativity
yes although and let me just say real
quick since i know the chronology of
episodes has over 300 in it right now
i'm always really impressed when it
actually gets through the entire thing
um black holes comp has two ways of
interest to us
in um in relativity in general
relativity
uh a black hole obviously that's where
we get the costs in the first place time
slows down nearby them the question
tends to be
if i take something like a neutron star
that's really close to the black hole
masculine and i accelerate up to high
speed
is it a black hole from someone else's
perspective and the answer is
if you're from that direction it can be
light slows down when it's leaving
something like a neutron star it's red
shifting away it gets dragged
if that thing is also moving away from
you very quickly yes that will become
invisible to you and so you could that
event horizon aspect
while you're traveling away from it seem
as while you're traveling towards a
black hole its event horizon will shrink
you'll see it gets smaller and you'll
never actually reach it yourself
uh as to their lifetime if you
accelerate a black warp to really high
speed
relative to you uh is it going to decay
longer as we know black holes have
according to stephen hawking a
evaporation period of time it's very
long
right for anything that's stellar mass
and natural very very long and the
bigger it is the longer it is
uh by orders of magnitude the question
is that if i get up at relativistic
speed say uh
99 of light speed where time travels
about 10th speed
is it also going to live 10 times longer
from our perspective
and the answer is yes that's just how
that works time is going slow from it
from our perspective but of course if
you chose to chase the race up to it get
to it you won't see it live longer
so it's kind of a yes and no solution to
that one
pyrex 06 thank you for your five dollar
contribution and their question is
is high gravity a fermi solution have
you
heard the um heard you need
seven stage rocket at two to three g
what tech would allow aliens to get off
of a high gravity planet
and is this an episode idea we've
actually talked about doing a high
gravity episode because we that lo our
life on a low gravity planet and i think
that actually is what we should come out
and do we now just keep getting delayed
on doing it
um but not a fully paradox solution
right um if you're doing the one you
know um
get all your eggs out of a basket before
you kill yourself thing with
civilizations as a foreign paradox
it certainly helps because every extra
minute you've got all your eggs in one
basket on that planet
gives you more time to wipe yourself out
means there's a lower probability of
getting off
so if that's the main solution the fermi
paradox the civilizations destroy
themselves we get to our technological
level
if they don't get out into the galaxy
first um
then higher gravity plants will be less
commonly featured in in
the galactic civilization uh however
there are many ways to get off the
planet and high gravity is certainly not
helping the process but it doesn't
necessarily hurt you that much either
you need a much stronger chemical rocket
to get out of your solar system but you
still
have uh off your planet that is you saw
the option on things like mass drivers
or orbital rings
is it hard to get up from them yes
absolutely but you also can start taking
badger options we don't normally bother
with because they are minimal gains
like uh well vacuum balloons and
raccoons uh that rockets that are
balloons that float up and then you
launch from them
and those can help you deal with some of
those issues hypersonic planes
skyhooks you start needing to use all of
these it's likely it would depress their
rate of development but they still know
the skies up there
and if we're going to develop systems
that will get us off this planet for
you know uh dollars a pound um
that we need to really be a spacefaring
civilization that's going to work
still on other planets it might be a
little bit more expensive but they'll be
able to get up there
and so double the uh gravity on that
surface they still can get off of it
they're just going to need to probably
wait another generation or two
atlas k says everyone is asking
practical space travel questions and i
just want to know which science fiction
books mr arthur would recommend
you know we have the book of the month
we do a lot of time uh although that's
not always my favorite science fiction
books they're usually ones i'm very fond
of
um they usually fit the top of the show
i would definitely recommend density
taylor's biblivo series that we
mentioned earlier that is a great book
series
uh starting with we are legion um other
science fiction books i always recommend
alice dale venomous revelation space
series it's
probably the best sci-fi series of last
decade
um classics the foundation i don't know
how the tv show for what's going to work
out but the book series is great at
least the first three books
the audio books connect to that series
like the robot novels by asthma
also great um dune uh
by frank hobart the book series is great
again one of those cases where some of
the sequels aren't necessarily as good
uh ando's game and a couple of the other
novels like speaker for the dad or endo
shadow by austin scott code other good
classics
um there are so many of them a bunch of
them on the shelf behind me
but if you guys can actually read those
titles for the screen
i think you mentioned many of them in
your list already probably
if you go to our website isaacarthur.net
which uh we usually link in episode
descriptions there is a tab that says
books
and that has a gigantically long list of
books that we've recommended i think
it's a few hundred entries on
it so that's probably a good place to
get started and really those aren't
books they're book series so
it should keep you somebody read for
several years or at least a very long
winter
explosive rpg gamer says will metallic
hydrogen become practical and how can it
be produced in large quantities
i i mean the most obvious way to produce
in large quantities would be at the
center of a gas giant or at least its
upper core that's the question that we
don't know the answer yet
is can we actually keep it stable
anything we could build it has to be
maintained at such high pressure
and we still have so very little of it
that we've actually produced in
laboratories that we don't really
know its properties very well you know
when you're dealing with a few atoms or
something
it's not as easy to get that good solid
baseline things like melting point and
pressure and the triple pointed material
as is when you've got a few liters of
stuff to be working with so
metallic hydrogen has the potential to
be the best chemical
rocket fuel period uh if we can
make it store it and use it we did an
episode on reusable rockets but it was
also focused on metallic hydrogen
early in the upward bound series like
year 30 i think it was
i believe the big news of time was that
spacex had just managed to land their
forced reusable rocket that way so
uh see that one for more details on how
metallic hydrogen works
gecus maxima says we hear from people in
the tech industry like steve wozniak and
so on
how will we reach singularity in 2050 or
so
do you have any comments on us i don't
think we will reach a technological
singularity uh in the next century
i think it's a very popular concept
popularized by folks like von revenge
and ray ko as well and others and
the basic reasoning goes like this if i
can build a computer that is capable of
learning or
build a computer that's as smart as a
human it should be able to figure out
how to build a smarter version of itself
or a smarter computer
and the next one should be able to do it
too and the idea is that you'll be able
to do it faster
i'm not quite sure how that follows that
you'll be able to build it when smalling
you faster because you're smarter you
know you're trying to build something
even more complex
humans have been trying to make a
smaller human for several thousand years
before teams of humans thousands of
humans have spent decades trying to make
basic artificial intelligence and we
still haven't really succeeded yet it's
very primitive
the assumption that if i turn on a
computer that's just a little bit
smaller than human it's going
to naturally on its own without a team
of each other i'll be able to make a
smaller one the next day
then we'll be able to make another
smaller one the next hour like a little
smaller one the next minute
the the exponential slope on
technological singularity
has never struck me as very logically
sound it's just
and again even when something is
logically sound that doesn't mean that
that's how it works out reality that's
why we do science
right when we actually look at the
experimental evidence the actual real
universe we often find
was logically sound to us is nonsense
so um the idea of moore's law of
constant w computers
the idea that you could build a computer
it's going to build a better computer
the next day
i don't feel that there's a very strong
argument for that and you need that
component to cause the technological
singularity because the idea is you have
one
supermind being created out of the blue
improvements
to computers smarter computers or
smarter people these are probably all on
the horizon
but the idea that there's just one that
exponentially goes fast and all the
others to bring about a technological
singularity
that i don't think is i think that's
more science fiction
concept it's good storyline it's not
very good science
i think this question ties in it's from
abby prakish
could a neurolink-like technology lead
to the network intelligence composed of
mind-melded humans
forming the first super intelligence you
know i could never hear no link anymore
without thinking of the paper where they
show you the mouse they plugged a
chip into its head so it looks like it's
got a mohawk uh coming out of the
skull where they wired it in uh
it's a great accomplishment but it's a
little creepy um i'm humorous
uh can you make a hive mind by wiring
people together
can you make a high mind by wiring
computers together yes if you actually
control the networking protocols and
software
don't assume because you can connect
people together that would make some
kind of hive mind or connectivity
it's like telepathy assuming you could
read human minds because they do emit
signals right
we can pick those up on mris there's
nothing coherent about that
you know it's like assuming you could
read a book by setting it on fire
uh you can't necessarily interpret that
data uh
in some kind of easy format if you want
to build a hive mind by connecting
people's brains together by something
like neurolink it should be possible but
it should be an automatic or easy
process either
um and then you have to ask yourself we
did do an episode on hive minds we point
out a lot like the word cyborg
and networked intelligence or a hive
mind is a very
relative term we already exist in a hive
mind
a social organism is a hive mind to some
degree you know group intelligence
it doesn't really have group personality
as much but even then various groups
organizations
tend to have a bit of a personality even
if they change over um
personnel inside them on that same note
when you invent something like
handwriting
um suddenly you have a hive mind that
includes people who are not only far
away from your distance
they write your letters but far away
from you in time you can talk to dead
people
you can have dead people in your hive
mind so it's a bit of a relative term
there
the question is whether or not it's
desirable and some people might find it
would be or not but i don't see me
snuggling for you just do it on accident
i don't you accidentally create a hive
mind with a bunch of people just
plugging into the internet with their
brain as opposed to their smartphone
uh let's take one more question then
we'll go to break okay we have a
a 10 donation from nathan gallup and he
says what do you think the of the belief
that we should not
explore new worlds because we could
contaminate any possible microscopic
biosphere
will this idea have any influence on
future exploration
it's a great question um there's two
key things on this first is if i come
across a wall that's got
complex life on it out there obviously
we don't want to be contaminating that
and we're not really worried about
spreading virus around those would
likely be compatible be more worried
about if the environment's anything like
ours our little microorganisms might
out-compete theirs
um so you go and you send very sterile
robots down this office you don't send
people
uh and you might make that your normal
process when you're investigating any
world because it's so much easier to
send a mechanical probe down first that
makes the most sense
and when you've done a lot of probing
then you find out if there's any life
there and you say well it's okay to have
people down there
and you might say yes if i find a world
that has
microscopic life on it right now we
don't want to touch that water because
it's new and unique
if i find a billion words out there that
have simple algae or or basic microbes
on them no matter how alien
after i've carried enough of them unless
they have something interesting about
that we say
sister it's just a bug you know so only
relatively complex biology i think would
you try to quarantine it after the
initial ones
there's so much to be learned though
it's not really a question of should we
preserve this for the sake of ethics
it's more of a
which is always a valid question but
also should we preserve this for the
sake of economy you know if you got into
a planet with entirely different life
basis foreign
you want to study that you don't want to
wipe that out that's got so many
applications
so i don't think we have to worry too
much about that conflict coming up into
play
as to whether or not we ever need to
worry about it all right to see how
common life and how common
complex life is out in the solar system
that's only in the galaxy
all right we're going to go out and
break for a couple minutes and we'll see
you then
we'll be on break for a few minutes so
it's a great time to grab a drink and a
snack
as i'm doing it's also a good time to
get more questions into our moderators
for the second half of the show
as a side note since these live streams
tend to be the only times i'm on camera
and folks get to look around my office
in studio
i want to take a quick moment to thank
perry stevens of ward work by me
for the nice woodcutter the sfia logo he
sent me as a gift last month
hanging up behind my desk if you want to
check out more of his work i'll leave
the contact info up on the screen
speaking of artists who work with the
channel i want to take a moment to thank
all the animators and composers whose
graphics or musical compositions appear
on the show
it is a great pleasure to get to work
with them and a great honor every time
someone tells me the show inspired a
painting
song short story or for that matter
another youtube channel or podcast
we always have a lot of questions we
don't get a chance to get to each live
stream though i try to get those in the
comments
afterwards or to use a few to start the
live stream off to give folks a chance
to get questions in
but there was a question near the end of
the last live stream by bass boy lag
asking about my opinions on cryonics and
if i'd freeze myself given the chance
the answer is probably yes though the
technology is still pretty primitive
and what you're really doing is gambling
that we can preserve you against better
future technology
it got me and sarah talking about it and
i remember that we had never done an
episode dedicated to cryonics
except for our sleeper ships episode
which is more about using it for space
colonization
so i decided that we would do an episode
on that cryonics frozen civilizations
and that will be out mid-winter early
next year
if you didn't know we tend to get about
a third of our episode ideas from
audience polls and much the remainder
originates in that sort of fashion
some member of the production crew or
audience mentions a concept or idea
and it sticks in my brain and i need to
write an episode on it so if bass boy
lag is watching today
thanks for the episode idea and to
everyone else down the years who has
suggested an episode or mentally prodded
me into thinking of one
thank you i am genuinely grateful to
have an audience full of fun and
creative folks
with all that said let's get back to the
show
and we're back sorry about that um so it
looks like we have a bunch more
questions so we're going to try to speed
up while we take these
uh and my wife say we'll continue to
read those after me
okay so the next question that we have
here is
from brick muppet
and thank you for the contribution and
they want to know regarding your recent
low-tech
space fares episode how early could we
have gone into space
for instance could the british have done
so in the 1930s
a manned moon mission and could it have
been made to work
potentially um you know we tend to think
of world war ii as in so many ways
advancing rocketry
for the obvious reasons but we've
already started to do some of that even
without that and it's entirely possible
that without the war
you never want to assume that wars
necessarily speed up technological
progress
i don't think though that you really
would have gotten that moon mission
going until it was a good deal cheaper
unless you had a lot more motivation to
get moving on that project
so i think the space race and world war
ii probably did cause us to get there a
little bit faster and would have
otherwise
different planet different psychology
different history maybe though they
could have got their bits you know
possibly in the authorities but really
pushing it you may be computers for that
too
gary itano thank you for your 27
contribution and he asks will
earth-based hydroponics make a
significant
um dent in planetary water scarcity
by when and how to prioritize yes
that amount is a gnd tip
off um the
trick on that is that i mean doesn't
necessarily hydroponics either could be
greenhouses
inside a greenhouse you have a very tiny
amount of water usage relative to
opening or farming because it's not
really going anywhere evaporates right
back down
hydroponics very water intensive but
again you're recycling that water a lot
better
uh the key of course with hydroponics is
the assumption that you are actually
doing that under a greenhouse too
because otherwise you'd be losing water
very quickly with hydroponics compared
to soil
both have the option to massively
increase the amount of food we produce
per acre or hectare of land the biggest
usage for those is can we make robots
they're very good attending crops
without being able to use tractors as
easily inside large greenhouses or
hydroponics facilities so
if we get the automation up to it then
yes they have the option to allow us to
increase
food production on the planet probably a
hundred fold
sam kong thank you also for your very
generous gift
and he says i always enjoy your videos
keep going
love you also do you think we can use
metallic hydrogen for rocket propulsion
the pressure seems too high it might be
it might turn out that you need
something like graphene or better or
even active support to keep the actual
rocket from exploding
again we just do not know the real
pressures involved yet and it might be
there too much for any material you
might be able to build metal hydrogen
may well turn out to basically be your
densest material you can make out that
kind of thing and it might explode under
any normal compression
but we might find some tricks around
that too we'll have to have macroscopic
lines with first
zoot suit jay-z says how would you
expect
taxation to play out in space commerce
uh almost initially uh the voucher quote
veterinary from discord series
the key to taxation is getting the
maximum milk for the minimum moo
of a cow um expect that if asteroid
mining starts turning off vast
quantities of gold for instance that uh
they're very shortly there afterwards
the the treasurer and the taxpayer will
be there to
start asking questions about how much of
that you'd like to donate to the cars at
war
so i'm sure you would have taxation in
space but it is likely to be
a little bit more challenging initially
aleister lachleel also
donated five dollars and asks is it even
possible to make a human level
or higher agi without sapience
hard to imagine that level of iq without
at least a parent
self-awareness i don't know that you
could have i mean it just depends on how
you're measuring intelligence
uh a supercomputer has more processing
power than an ant
um we've passed that point some time
back whether or not
it is going to be enough that actually
intelligent on its own though that's not
the question you might be able to make
something as big as a macho matrioscope
right now
a solar system-wide computer without it
being sapient but
i think the more brains you give it the
more likely you are to potentially be
generating one probably the easier would
be to do it on accident or on purpose so
we just don't know yet though virginia
hansen
says what's your opinion of planetary
production
if there is life on mars and venus
should we preserve them or use the
planet
since the life will never be sentient
and will die off anyway
there is the question of whether or not
it's even worth trying to quarantine a
place
for millions of years um if that's
plausible can you really
quarantine a planet for millions of
years and if you can't
then it doesn't matter because it's
going to contaminate destroy whatever
point of life is there
it's a lot easier to quarantine
something like an o'neill cylinder which
is why i have to suggest the best way to
preserve nature
isn't to move the civilization off of
earth but to build your protected biomes
inside an audio solo where you can keep
it nice and
safely inside uh that might be the way
we go with a lot of these things is to
put little natural resources on them
um and or around them in orbit
and again that just comes down to a
question of two key things
do you want to preserve microbes once
you've studied them and have samples
them
and uh do you really have that option
because in many cases
it might be really hard to quarantine
them especially if most your
civilization says why are we preserving
microbes
we study them they don't have any
importance beyond that
willie teps asks someone mentioned that
you could ignite a gas giant by dropping
a nuclear device
into its hydrogen helium core is this
possible
not really um you could probably do it
by dropping well you could do it by
dropping a neutron star into it for
instance but
that's not really igniting the gas giant
the neutron star while vastly smaller
also vastly out masses what you're
really doing is igniting the
neutron star with some new fuel from a
gas giant
same for black hole but you might be
just cramming micro black on there
and so long as it's uh absorbing matter
a little bit faster than it's emitting
uh waste energy it should be able to
actually cause a fusion reaction around
it
but drop your nuclear by itself
dt phenom hey isaac how do you think
history will be preserved and studied in
the future
how will historians deal with the light
lag when it goes into centuries
and millennia that is an interesting
thought because you'd have to be a
really old professor to get to
and verify anything gets hard too you
want to write back a note to say well we
got this signal from you guys from a
thousand years ago
that said this is how the rebellion
worked and we avoided the codes might
not have been the normal ones before
authentication was this a valid source
or were you hijacked by your rebels
and they might say no well of course not
oh hey our new leader from a thousand
years ago you know
that was ten thousand years ago and of
course that's how history played out
it's not just trying to keep history
over a billion awards and a billion
years
it's trying to keep a billion different
you know arguing copies of it around
because you got what the neighbors
report what you report whatever and
sanitize change around revised
all mixing together it'd be very hard in
many ways a lot of key stuff should
stick around too i'd imagine
um so history you might see the end of
history but then some people say we kind
of already reached the end of history in
terms of
we record everything now so very
debatable point
okay we have another question here from
another isaac isaac freeman
and he is donating 228 dollars thank you
and he says what do you think of the
idea that the only civilizations that
survive long enough to have space
variant civilizations
become irrationally cautious and will
therefore hide
all their signatures to avoid all
possible detections
by another civilization to maximize
chances of survival
the key there has to be irrationally
conscious cautious because if they're
rationally cautious it doesn't really
behoove you to hide
as we were joking in nature and we
talked about this in the hidden aliens
episode we kind of go through these
arguments in more details
in nature if you want to protect your
territory that you need to to live
you announce that your territory um
because it might bring a fight on but
it's a lot more likely
to cause people to avoid it because
fights are expensive even if you're
bigger than the other guy
you know maybe one in ten times he's
gonna win so you go through ten of those
fights and you're dead
right you avoid conflict where possible
because it's expensive so you mark your
territory
so in space you mark that by putting up
a beacon that says here i am
um you're also the problem that if you
are attacking people who come into your
territory and they didn't know it's your
territory
um they're going to send an
investigation to find out what happened
if that doesn't come back they're going
to send an armada to ask more you know
pointed questions so hiding not the best
approach but it might be an irrational
approach
the question is whether or not that's
one to be followed by most civilizations
and i don't think that leads to
quietness i think what you do
is if you really wanted to avoid
transmitting your homeworld even
assuming you decided that was a good
idea
you launched your space probe out in a
different direction for
a thousand years and then you tell it to
transmit and send a hello signal
and send back any relays to that so it's
basically you're
playing telephone tag by bouncing the
signal off some other place
that way you're potentially getting more
information
the bird that knows what's good says do
you think
augmented reality or virtual reality
will be more prominent in the near
future
and which has a stronger capacity to
change the world
augmented reality would always end up as
more prominent because it would be
something you could do while you're
doing your normal day-to-day stuff
remember augmented reality is something
as simple as
you've got a little clock you can see in
your normal field of vision letting you
know what time it is or the
incoming phone call is happening that's
augmented reality
virtual reality is likely to be mostly a
recreational training thing
uh so it might have a very big role uh
especially if you're using to educate
children who then become very
comfortable using as adults
but i think that its principle of what
would be entertainment educationally on
whereas
augmented reality be the day-to-day
thing um they are different than their
approaches though i think you
got the one you see a lot of the other
two paul dickinson
asks are there any ways for an
interstellar civilization to wipe
themselves out
oh yeah the
the problem with natural disasters is
that they have i mean you can't even
with like a quasar with these sterile
isogalactic civilization but
um as an example if you have an alien
fleet coming towards you say well let's
go ahead and scatter ourselves off to a
million colonies
so they can try and chase us down well
they're smart they saw your engines
flying off so they can hunt you down
if you're an interstellar civilization
you are incredibly vulnerable to anyone
who really wants you dead and is smoked
they know where you live they're just
going to go and pound on your houses it
just takes them longer to get to all of
them
bolsh gives a donation of five dollars
and says would a world war
accelerate or decelerate space expansion
what other world events may drastically
accelerate or decelerate space
travel progress um i mean we were just
talking about that a little bit earlier
with the uh getting the moon example
you know history is always a little bit
of an opinion-based thing
there is a general feeling that world
war ii accelerated scientific progress
uh and that the aftermath court war did
too i would say the cold war did a lot
more for science than
world war ii did and i'd point out a
core concept there being that almost
nobody died in that war yeah i mean yes
there were casualties but there was
nothing like
world war ii and no one was destroying
your scientific resource facilities no
one was killing your scientists no one
was blowing up your universities
and none of your students who would vote
in those universities or in those
research labs were off shooting people
for living instead they were at those
facilities doing research
so i would say that what world war ii
mostly did was cause us to spend a lot
of money
on those things proud of that we really
didn't spend as much money on education
and uh at the university level or on
funding research facilities and so while
war
certainly you know necessity some other
invention there are other sources of
necessity
uh to mother inventions besides uh
war warfare so it can help but i don't
think it's necessary for it
everton plaza also a 10 donation
and he says speculative fermi solution
what if the galaxy is so abundant with
life that aliens feel the need to
obscure observations to test them rather
than
uplifting a primitive species to prevent
overcrowding
uh you can't really prevent galactic
overcrowding
by preventing other people from joining
the community you either curtail your
own exponential growth and get advanced
to it or you don't
so if they of the opinion that the only
reason that we don't have an overcrowded
galaxy would be because they're not
letting other people into the club
that's not going to work out very well
they just say well we'll let you in the
club
if you agree not to explode your
population out and claim a million words
for yourself
um it's always possible though it's a
lot of effort to go through the
to obscure yourself um and it's also
question is
why is it that this new species that's
later on the scene is somehow less
worthy of being a galactic civilization
than the other ones who are behind the
scene so why are you going to keep them
down rather than letting them out and
join you especially you can't control
the terms of that joining better
if they get out there otherwise they
find you behind yourself on them
that creates from the moment of
introduction a bit of a hostility
i think not really the best approach
possible but i don't think so
that's the way i do at least sorry go
ahead okay
protracted people's pandemic uh they had
a question earlier
and they say great response thanks and
are giving a gift of 20 along with a
second question
do you have thoughts on henry bergson
bergson was a philosopher who beat
einstein in a debate
he thinks we think of time like we think
of space but that is wrong
space provides for objects and time for
subjects
i know the name but i'm afraid i'm not
terribly read up on him
um scientists often don't meet the best
philosophers and vice versa
although science is natural philosophy
and and sadly i would actually say very
few scientists
spend as much time on philosophy as they
should i know i'm a little behind that
myself too
um but uh i'm afraid i'm still familiar
enough with boxing's arguments people
say
whether or not he actually beat einstein
in that debate it's fairly or not but
einstein you know was uh booking a very
new concept so he might have been
overlooking very good responses but it
was true for all i know
brick muppet thank you for your 10
donation and
regarding your low tech excuse me
regarding your recent
low tech space farers episode how early
could we have gone into space oh i did
ask that one already i believe
okay um that was the question on the
mandatory
um marcus will five pound donation
what would your argument be against the
idea of delaying exploring mars until we
fix
problems on earth walk and chew bubble
gum
um you don't solve your problems with
uh this planet by not going and
venturing other planets
many of the technologies that help you
terraform or travel other wars be a vast
use here
but again just an example solar power
does not really work on earth as well as
we would like it to
you got clouds you got nighttime um and
you got space limitations
uh space is full of space it's got very
few clouds and it doesn't have any night
time you know space is eternal daylight
so it's great for solar power uh many of
our awards problems in terms of power
would be solved just by going ahead
and um being able to transmit power down
from power satellites we discussed
before
or from having a much better nuclear
power supply available from something
like the moon
um many of our industries would do
better off in space too
all the technology terraform plans
applies to fixing earth issues
ecologically too and vice versa
so i don't accept the idea that we
should be delaying any of these things
but
it begins like saying let's start fusion
research until we cured cancer
some people are focused on cancer
resources some people are focused on
future you can prioritize a bit but only
to a degree
get diminishing returns by trying to
dump stuff on things especially they're
all kind of tied together to some degree
antares mc question mostly for world
building
i've set a story on a globular cluster
to go a bit around light lag
how much hand wavium would be needed to
make it habitable
a globular cluster well you probably
would have parts of a glopular cluster
that will actually habitable
uh especially on the edges it just
depends on how
tight it is and how old it is um i don't
think you need too much hand wave you
know especially if you weren't implying
that life evolved there
rather than settle there no problem at
all there's going to be plants around
there and
you can even colonize the core of the
galaxy not the actual
core core where the black hole is at the
last option too but that's very tiny the
smaller
solar system uh you have extra problems
to deal with in terms of more radiation
more like more perturbations but
nothing that civilization able to reach
that place in the first place wouldn't
be able to handle
ghost doctor i would like to know what
isaac thinks the most probable course to
interplanetary colonization will be
among the possibilities when and whether
we'll make it before ruining the earth
um i firmly believe that we will get to
other planets and get colonized before
we ruin the planet because i tend to
feel very formally that we won't
do the latter we you know you could
you always have problems facing
ourselves we've done very good at
managing to fix avoid or
mitigate the damage from other previous
crises um
patience and optimism help and they're
not always pointed but i usually find
life is much better if you approach them
that way
as to a forced colonization target i
would say the moon
than the asteroid belts except i'm sure
end of doing moles before we do most the
asteroid belt too because we seem to
really want to
but i don't think mueller offers us that
much as a colony
other than practice time o'brien
do you think it's smart to start our
real outside earth activities
by colonizing a planet instead of
starting with bigger habitats and space
installations i'm sorry i guess that's
similar
we can't just answer that one and we all
try to get through these faster because
i gather there's a bit of a backlog
i've already passed on normal time but
we did start light uh due to the
technical hours
um the moon's the first place to really
get colonized for resources but not only
they interested in colonizing the moon
uh we're interested for raw materials so
that that's kind of key thing
if we want to colonize a planet that
becomes a focus it's a purpose
uh but if you just want raw materials to
expand the space start with the moon
start with the asteroid belts and
build a round off and build where you
need to so
isaac freeman has a second generous
contribution for today and he says
what do you think of the idea that the
only civilizations that survive
long enough to have space variant
civilization did i read this one earlier
become irrationally cautious and will
therefore hide others
no i'm sorry i i think maybe i did
misread that one okay
um lacuna craft 10
donation love the work you do and i'm
wondering your thoughts on landing on
planets versus just using them for their
resources space habitats seem to have
a huge amount of benefits compared to
the planetary colony
did we just do that question did we or
something very similar
uh well everyone knows i'm a big fan of
space habitat so
the more we can be building them up um
the better
you can make a space habitat to be
almost any kind of
ecology set up environment that you want
to be plants you're more limited
and you have to do all nothing you have
to colonize the entirety of the planet
in most cases as opposed to just burning
one
island's eye cylinder half joseph
viscaletti five pound donation would it
be practical to build
unmanned space infrastructure which is
using fusion power
fission power and space reactors for
cooling
i'm sorry fission power and space for
reactor cooling
yes but you got to keep in mind when
you're as close
to the sun as we are you are in a state
of perpetual light so the first thing
you have to do is build a big mirror
around yourself big shade to keep that
light off you so you can actually cool
down
and you do want to be a meal because
otherwise you're absorbing all that heat
then you can do radiators you
potentially doing that all the way up by
the sun
so you can cool anywhere in space with a
big umbrella
but you're often going to want that
power anyway if you're trying to block
that all out why not just use it as your
heater too
so yes you can use as a cooling system
uh vadine fins but i think you probably
always use that in combination with
sucking up that energy too
acharos with a 20 pound donation have
you heard of gavin wintz's
existex theory of three dimensional time
or h
plus h negative higgins boson
also what are your thoughts on hidden
antimatter in the universe being
responsible for strange things not
explained by science
i have heard of that but i i i gotta
tell you i barely remember any
discussion of it i am not as updated on
higgs boson stuff as i should be
and all i remember for that is just the
name uh as the hidden antimatter
it would i mean if there was an equal
amount of antibiotic produced there's
normal matter it absolutely has been
hiding somewhere
but i'm not thinking of any strange
anomalies that it could be causing
that would that would have function we'd
expect antimatter to have and why it's
better with super rare
we do know its properties really well so
you'd expect all those anomalies to
correspond what you'd expect from
antimatter popping up
okay i have three more questions from
today that i think we can get to
um in our time frame here we have a 10
pound donation from hiroshi
and he says would a strange matter gun
be a game changer
there's a thought that with uh well
there are six types of quarks up and
down make up almost everything
in the universe that we're used to
dealing with you also have the strains
charm
and bottom and top uh i don't know why
we have a top and a bottom
cork as well as an up and down cork but
we do the strange quark
is thought to potentially be able to
form atoms but it turns everything into
strange quarks like
we were concerned that if you had a
strange a stable strange
core piece of metaphor into a star it
might turn the entire star
into strange matter the basis for that
in terms of having tested out is very
hypothetical
i'm not even sure if if that's still
allowed under the current theories but
if it did have that property obviously
that would be a very
incredibly potent weapon like anything
else that you're deploying that it kind
of has a
uh escalating effect if you can shoot a
seat of strange man or something and it
turns out the interstrange metal
wow that want a weapon because it's
probably going to blow up the planet if
you hit it with one little particle
strange metal then
um you can't just change around all the
quark bases of some planet and not have
it explode basically so
uh if it works that way then yes that is
a
very very powerful weapon tom smith
has a five dollar donation do you think
the star trek replicator or something
close to it will ever be viable
no neville uh in the way that we see it
mostly used which is to get
tea or gray hot yes
in the sense that you could probably
very rapidly spit out hot water and tea
flavoring into it
very fast processing of food or things
like that very customizable things yes
but that kind of rapid assembly
especially they say they're assembly out
of raw energy like that
um that even if you had cheap
teleportation like they have in star
trek
um should result in vast explosions and
and deadly levels of radiation every
time he used it
i think people tend to overestimate the
amount of unrest with the amount of
energy involved
this cup if it were made out of you know
if we totally turn this into raw energy
this is about a kilogram here um and it
should
go off at what 10 to 17 joules of energy
if it was just exploded
in which case that would be what
several hundred megatons of nuclear
explosion that would be it would be
devastating you know it
is critical to understand that you start
trying to assemble bits of matter out of
nothing that you're going to have a lot
of spillover to
as heat and energy so i don't see
anything like a star trek black potato
apple being
out there you just manufacture things in
seconds like that now
the inguian has donated
50 something
when do you think we will move on to
more advanced propulsion methods and
what new technology in that field do you
think that we will see
you know that's what you mean by more
advanced uh if you're talking about like
the ones we have right now on the
drawing board or prototype sub but
haven't actually built in mass like an
ion drive
uh vasmir or even like light propulsion
we often not talk about using solar
sails or laser proportion
those are not really what i think of as
new propulsion as new theory and so the
other way like the alcubierre drive
would be
um on the other hand any one of those
could
suddenly hit the prototyping testing and
real
economic industrial usefulness level in
years or decades something like that and
it's hard to predict how long that would
happen
i never thought reusable rockets was
going to be something we'd see
in a decade and uh decided to say the
spacex they really surprised me there
any one of these technologies out there
only i thought it was being much easier
to do than
a reusable rocket that could land itself
um
but we'll just have to see how that
develops i would tend to bet the big
focus for interplanetary travel for now
will be on the ion drive
uh just because you could potentially do
that with solar power and not have to
use nuclear which makes a lot of people
uncomfortable in terms of getting the
resource up there so
ion drive is probably going to be the
biggest focus for new proportion for
interplanetary travel for now
uh do we have any other questions are we
good to wrap up the day well that was
the three that we were planning to get
to so
i think we'll have to save the rest for
uh kicking off our november livestream
we sure sure if you've got any other
questions put in the live stream we do
try to carry those over the next time
and you also put in the comments i
usually get back to them with inside the
day or so to give some answers
so i thank you everyone for joining us
today sorry for the only hiccup with the
technical entry
started and we will see you next month
and we'll also see you
next thursday
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook
reddit discord or our website
isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
thursday
[Music]
you
