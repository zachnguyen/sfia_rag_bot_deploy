Orbital Rings are an alternative to a space 
elevator that rely on active support to remain  
up. See our episode on Orbital Rings for details, 
but typically they hang by having one ring  
spinning faster than orbital speed inside another 
ground-stationary ring, with a combined angular  
momentum equal to what their combined mass needed 
to orbit properly. You can run as many tethers as  
you like up to that orbital ring, and those 
tethers need only a fraction of the strength  
a space elevator needs, and tethers may run out 
at angles to service a wide band of communities  
under the ring. While easiest at the Equator, 
you can tilt one so that it runs over any two  
chosen points on Earth. It will precess if left 
on its own, but as it is tethered to the ground  
by thousands of ultra-strong transport cables, 
they will keep the ring stationary to the ground.  
In this way a series of tilted orbital rings 
and angled tethers can provide direct, simple,  
and cheap travel to space or anywhere 
else on Earth in only an hour or two.
