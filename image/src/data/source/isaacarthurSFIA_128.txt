The most recent Star Wars show on Disney+ 
has reignited an old discussion on if  
you could get stabbed by a lightsaber 
and live, as opposed to quickly slashed,  
and the answer of course is we have no idea, 
as they operate under fictional science that  
changes from film to film. Back in Phantom 
Menace we see them melting though blast doors,  
then we see Qui-Gon get stabbed by Darth Maul 
and he takes a while to die. The assumption was  
Maul was gloating on a fatal strike, since 
he easily could have bisected him at that  
point and Qui-Gon’s own weight should have done 
that too. Maybe a Jedi Master could put a force  
shield up around the wound given an instant 
to concentrate, but we would expect the blade  
to catch stuff on fire. But stuff is clothing, 
and maybe the fat in your body near the wound.  
Water makes up most of your body and hydrogen 
and oxygen do burn but it takes more energy to  
separate water into hydrogen and oxygen then they 
release when burned, so there’s no chain reaction.  
You should be horribly seared and probably dead, 
but you won’t actually self-immolate into ashes.
