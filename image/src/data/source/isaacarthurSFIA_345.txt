good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly livestream q
a we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink and a
snack
though we'll take a break about halfway
through too with all that said
welcome and let's get started
good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly livestream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead i don't think we're actually
live yet can you see anything on your
end
no no one sitting on the chat end no
oh good god there's always something
isn't there um
we should be live right now
okay
can anyone see me at the moment because
it's still nothing
why is it always to be some strange
glitch at the last minute
it says the live stream started at a
different url
okay so that might just be i think i'm
different live so i thought he was
apparently watching this live well i've
been uh
looking around confused
this is what happens when you're looking
into outer space for the next wave of
the future
and it doesn't arrive at the moment you
thought it would is that called a time
lag
light lag but yeah time-lapse let me see
if i can get this thing to
uh well that's actually that's fine
right there why aren't you going to
refresh the youtube thing and ask me
that first question for us what do you
think it's back
we have a lot of folks that are looking
for you and it says it's still waiting
who's still waiting on youtube oh my
word
well we're definitely live at this point
it's different url if you uh hmm
can somebody who's in the chat go ahead
and paste the current
live actual link into the chat window
for the folks who are in the chat
already
and are not on the right link for it
might be the other link
oh well they will hopefully refresh
let's go to get started with our
questions
kind of makes you wish we know what dave
was make cocoa bombs instead
if anyone who saw last week sarah is
back in the studio with us today
uh david thomas who'd been with us uh
last month philly info
he was actually live streaming from his
parents house today making coco bombers
his mom
hot chocolate and marshmallows and
sprinkles
and it looked a lot more fun than uh
well
than technical glitches now of course
this is far more fun than drinking hot
chocolate
if you don't know you have a drink and a
snack such as hot chocolate you can grab
one of those right now but
we're gonna go ahead and get started
with our first question from last month
and then we'll get you on court ones
okay well we had a question from thomas
perkins
that he wanted to know what your
thoughts are for a realistic
and long-term solution for mitigating
radiation dangers for space colonization
uh that's always kind of a tricky thing
in the sense that we have the
the core issue with radiation space is
that there's no atmosphere blocking it
out but it is always about thickness
magnetic fields can help with ionized
particles for instance but magnetic
fields like the earth have
do not in any way stop gamma radiation
right
oxygen stops gamma radiation hydrogen
stops gamma radiation
nitrogen stops gamma radiation stuff in
between it and you stops it
uh beta radiation can be stopped by
magnetic field because it's just an
electron or posturon
um but by and large anything that we can
do with a spaceship we can
you know in towson planet we can
replicate the spaceship in this case we
just need to think a hall
is you get bigger heavier spaceships
because you're not building tiny things
held together by tin foil the square map
they sorry the square cube law lets you
start
having thick or shielding without being
proportionately larger chunk of your
budget
and you don't start doing things like
putting your stuff that's radiation
proof like
water on the outside so you put all your
storage tanks for water
in your floor of like a spinning
spaceship that's more or less how you
get around it is you put electromagnetic
field around the
ship if you want to but mostly you just
put in an awful lot of mass between you
and the outside
okay well it seems that we have a lot of
folks
joining us on the main page that is
where the live stream is streaming from
at the moment
and we have a question from medievalists
if we aimed a probe to another star
should we not choose a star that is
trailing behind our own system
wouldn't that be faster than sending it
to alpha centauri
alpha centauri is not part of our group
uh in terms of things that
we formed with naturally when this
system formed we had some stars we were
moving with
some of those were still for moving away
i thought those were kind of
intersecting
and alpha centauri is not one of those
so it does actually have a speed
relative to us that's fairly significant
but
to be honest it's not that much compared
to what the distance is
if you want to get you know the probe
there fairly quickly
it's the best one to send it to i'd
still say or proxima centauri anyway
um but about the same difference but
really any of the stars in our local
area
none of them are moving that fast that a
space probe that could get there in a
lifetime or two
uh wouldn't more or less ignore that
speed it's not that big of a difference
if you're trying to get one they are at
the current speed of voyage or yes it
matters but there's no point in setting
a probe to
start with 70 000 years getting there uh
when it's only four light years away
just wait and then sometimes next 30
thousand years get better technology of
getting stuff there
so we have a a question here with a
super chat
and i had the name and it went away so
maybe we'll come back to that one
we have a question here from michael
mcchesney and he says
isaac in the past you've said you don't
want to go into space
yourself but if you were offered a seat
on the all civilian inspiration for
space launch would you accept before you
answered the answer is only if you take
me with you only yeah well only if i
took my wife with me which
says it has to be fairly safe um
i am not super anxious to get into space
uh
any more than i am to go on a cruise
ship those are all hobbies of the folks
showing
i might turn out that i really like them
i was never anxious to go whitewater
rafting we went to what was in august
i loved it i loved it i was half blind
the entire time because i couldn't bring
any kind of special glass along and i'm
like
2200 vision so it was a lot of fun if
you have not gotten white water i have
to go while you're rafting
but safely um if you haven't gone to
space before
i don't know if i'm gonna enjoy it or
not you're probably asking the
astronauts they all say they love it so
it's something hopefully in about 30 40
years will actually be no more expensive
than an expensive cruise line ticket but
even then we're looking forward to the
day when it's more expensive than
airline ticket
plan our summer vacation for 20 years
out yeah you know so the summer vacation
for 2041
sounds good okay i'll be 61 then i might
like space slow gravity
ronnie says how far do you think we will
reach into space this century
in most of our time spans i don't know
if he's looking at my time span or your
time span but
yeah yeah i suppose technically if you
wanted to andromeda on this century it's
hypothetically possible from your own
relative time perspective
uh you just have to go really fast um
this century i would expect us to
actually have a decent chance of
launching an interstellar ship i
wouldn't expect it to arrive
this century but i wouldn't put it past
it probably a probe
a man vessel is probably a little bit
further ahead as to
us if by the end of the century we don't
have a base
on the moon i had a permanent
significant base on the moon
and we haven't mined an asteroid or two
and haven't set up several
space stations that have people on them
pretty much all the time
then odds are pretty good that sort of
thing isn't happening because it turns
out to be technically impossible
we can never really rule that out so
we've done it but that was what i expect
this century i really i can't imagine
taking longer than that
matt 333 says could you create a video
about that kind of intelligent alien
that could have a higher level of
consciousness
we're actually doing an episode on
sentience um
coming up in about middle of middle of
mulch it might be one of the ones that's
been playing up in the background
assuming they have been
um and uh there's out of the image slash
oh yeah it's been up there
um trying to figure out what the line is
treating things like sapiens higher
consciousness lesser consciousness we
even come up with the term in the
episodes
it's uh called pythian just kind of
bridge the gap between sentience and
sapiens
um trying to talk about something that's
kind of tricky because we don't have any
examples to look at
but it would be interesting to speculate
on what it would be like if somebody had
a higher than human level of
consciousness
um but it's so hard to say
i i am going to call out this one it's a
super chat from curator callister
and thank you for your donation he says
hey isaac i just wanted to let you know
that your content has really helped me
through quarantine
we've had quite a few friends that ended
up in that situation this year
and uh glad that it's helping his
question
is what are the top three most realistic
sci-fi works of fiction
i'm imagining he's watching quite a few
of them at the moment yeah hmm
i guess it depends if you're going by
books movies or tv
and it's gonna be a different answer for
each of them it also depends what you
mean by realism
your classic top three sci-fi novel
series pretty much always pop up on
there as the favorite so
isaac asmus foundation frank corports
dune and orson scott cards endorse game
um the in terms of realism they each
have beautiful realism in certain
aspects but then they have
really horrible flaws like the whole
concept of
the foundation is psycho history a math
to predict the future in broad
strokes that is just not possible right
that violates
all sorts of basic mathematical and
physical concepts that you got doing an
entire series based off the idea that a
civilization that has anti-gravity and
fashion like travel cannot bring water
to a planet when water is the most
common molecule in the universe
and would probably be hanging on the
outskirts of every single solar system
uh then we've got uh endoscope
scott carl's game was the idea that you
could run a military
complex strategy across tons of systems
by using
um i was being a 14 year old
and a bunch of other teenagers so
sliding scales of realism
um most realistic television show
it really wouldn't be star trek it used
to always say star wars star trek and
trek was more sweet but one i really
don't see the basis for that
um but you get certain amount of realism
on so many of them i'd say movie wise
sunshine minus the last 30 minutes and
the basic premise
very good movie for instance from 2007
the moon 2009 that was very good one but
we'd go through all of them um
interstellar has its points
i most of them though they've just got
cool fundamental flaws to them that make
me has to just call them out as very
scientific
skylar reek says what would a card shift
3 civilization in another galaxy have
affect us politically if we discovered
them tomorrow
um if we discovered a kardashev 3
civilization in another galaxy
i i suppose it is important that it be
in another galaxy because it was in our
galaxy
called chef 3 civilization for those who
don't know is a galaxy spanning empire
one that's not only set on every solar
system but
dyson's field every single star so you
can't see any stars you know
night sky objects in your galaxy
if you have gun car chef three except
maybe other galaxies we can see
andromeda with the naked eye for
instance
um one that was actually in another
galaxy actually andromeda
or even at all you know that that
civilization
was ancient before we
were building pyramids you know that's
even ignoring light light you know that
that thing was millions of years old
when that light left you and they were
already millions of years old
that changes your perspective but at the
same time i don't know that it really do
much more than shock us for a little bit
because it can form certain options
also because i know someone's going to
bring it up redoing i do know
that in books 3 and beyond he does say
that there's those sand warm trout
that uh encapsulate the water on the
desert planet and sink it down in there
but
this this has to be consistent for book
one i think
that's what it counts so while you're
talking about shows that you've seen
uh war giver thank you for your
contribution he wants to know
if you've ever seen ghost in the shell
the movie
the cartoon movie i've seen um i've not
read the manga
i've not seen the newer version scots
uh i can't remember who i am in it i've
seen the the
realistic do you think the technology
and it is
um a lot of it really is in some ways
that's one of the more realistic
uh animes i've seen which to be fair
i've not seen very many um
basic concepts there being you have
cyborgs and people can hop around bodies
we see a simple thing with the altered
carbon series is
that the mind is moving around digitally
or not and can be manipulated if you can
move a mind around and you can set
signals around to it then you should be
able to manipulate it digitally as well
and so that whole series kind of looks
the question of
how malleable is this concept we call
personality uh
how solid object is you and that of
course
is something we're going to find out uh
in this next century or two i'm quite
sure and hopefully the answer
will be much less dystopian than we see
in in shows like those
randy smith says if any of our new
nearby stars go nova and aim a gamma ray
burst at us how far underground would
you have to be to escape
at least the radiation uh
in your basement in your basement
gamma ray boss it depends on how tight
it is if
our sun was suddenly a supernova
candidate that was able to do a
gamma-ray burst a pulsar um
then yeah we'd have to be pretty deep on
the ground to survive that direct
hit uh but it is still cone that widens
out
anything that's even four light-years
away it's going to rip the atmosphere
off in terms of ionizing it but you
yourself would not be killed by the
radiation even just
under a meter of earth so
so can we make an entire galaxy a ship
by building an engine around the black
hole in the center of the milky
way i'm going to do it that way um it's
possible but
uh you gotta keep mine the black hole in
the center of the galaxy is not really
the the thing that which the galaxy is
wrapped around it just happens to be
where that black hole would tend to
naturally be at as a very big object
that uh would form more commonly there
um
the galaxy outmasters that black hole by
a factor of about a hundred thousand to
one
so don't think of it as too much of an
anchor um not a bad place to be dumping
mass
into to try to push galaxy along but
it's not really a good gravitational
angle and of itself
you want to move a galaxy you want to
move large chunks of it'll
gravitationally bound to each other you
don't really want to leave bits up
behind
um and uh in that kind of context
let's see the fleet of stars episode for
a better look at that but you really
want to be trying to move the whole
thing
each star was a chicago thruster kind of
situation or a black hole based type
engine i think you kind of elaborated on
this question from merv johnson already
but thank you merv for your uh
contribution here
and he says back in the clark tech
episodes you mentioned
different types of mass inertial and
active gravity passive gravity can you
elaborate a little bit more on those
here
sure um this cup uh
which is quite a big footage the example
this cup that jason and christina bought
me while they were down at disneyland
some years back
um has mass that is inertial
gravitational and active and passive
gravitational
if we think of these things we say the
mass of them is all the same because
they seem to
act as the same quantity to us in a
naive sense but
if i want to move this cup i have to
push on it and something resists
to give this cup inertia i have to push
on it and something resist if i were to
double this cup or drink more of the
coffee out of it it would be easier to
push
that's inertial mass how much it was
just being pushed on
by you know accelerating forces active
gravitational mass is how much
it pulls other objects so like it's
exerting a little bit of a pull of
gravity on me right now
right it yanks at me and then there's
passive gravitational mass which is
how much it gets shanked on by me and we
have no real reason to think that these
should be the same quantities
but they seem to be right we figure they
got to be linked together
at a very core level but that actually
is to us a theoretical level we don't
know yet but they are three
separate quantities if why they are
linked together presumably there is a
good reason
for why they are the same we don't know
it yet but they are
three separate quantities how much this
thing resists being pushed
right how much it pours on the earth and
how much the earth pulls
on it or beyond it and vice versa those
are your three types of mass
your gas varat says so my question is
relating to how gravity stretches
space and time in relation to distance
growing between galaxies
is it possible that the actual distance
is not increasing
but that the density and i just lost the
rest of it so
make up whatever you want for the rest
of the ending do you remember who it was
i think i might have in the chat
that's right so unfortunately today a
couple of
folks who helped us out on the live
stream are not available today oh they
all popped on we have
the owl and stellarator oh okay all
right is that that one's not in there
well it was a uh it says continued but
it doesn't continue
so what was the question it was about it
was about how gravity stretches space
and time in relation to distance
okay i'm guessing the question on that
one is is it possible instead of the
space between galaxies expanding we are
getting compacted
a g things are shrinking in size or that
in some fashion the light skin slowed
down
as it passes through their mind we did
talk about that a little bit more in the
dark matter technology episode
without knowing this is the question
obviously i can't only kind of sort of
answer it
um but uh we don't know if the universe
is scheme bigger or everything is
getting smaller
that's one of those um
questions where it's the answer is
effectively the same anyway
you could never tell if you're shrinking
everything else is getting bigger or not
it's it's
how would you know um on the other hand
is something causing light to slow down
between galaxies for instance to cause
that effect
um we don't know um we haven't been
outside of galaxies to test this stuff
it really hasn't just say no we have no
reason to suspect that's the case though
we say things like
why is the universe expanding understand
that
this relies on the idea that the
conservation of energy
the most fundamental physical law we
have besides entropy
doesn't work right for the universe to
expand like that
via dark energy means that in some
fashion even if it's not
really it's more of a global rather than
local effect conservation of energy is
broken
so it's not exactly something we just
picked out of a hat one day we fought
tooth and nail
everybody didn't like this theory it's
kind of one of those things where after
we eliminate every other plausible
option that's the only thing that was
left over at that time
and uh things like slow light were
definitely disgust
but we don't see any basis or reason for
that to work and a lot of the things we
do look at say
probably not so i just realized
that it's not january 31st no are you on
the january 31st episode
it's february 28th and that was why the
live stream link was broke because it
says january 31st
kind of like a month behind here the ins
and outs of the various pumps now
wouldn't it really have puzzled everyone
if it was february 29th
i mean it could just get lost every four
years yeah no um you know
i'm glad i don't have that february 20th
birthday i guess most people run the
march for us
yeah i guess so if we ever have a kid on
for on
february 29th does that mean they only
get old once again
one birthday every four years yeah well
i suppose that's really nice one at that
point if you only give it a birthday
present every four years that's like
well i want a pony
[Laughter]
oh my say well it's too late for this
year you could ask me to get in four
years
yeah that sounds sinister
it's it's well you know it's all about
effective parenting yeah
oh oh well glad to know that ahead of
time
eric johansson thank you for your
super chat here he says if environmental
and political concerns are disregarded
do you think it's feasible to create
nuclear rocket engines that can take off
from the earth
um
thermal i mean nuclear thermal rockets i
i'm open to the idea of that or even the
nuclear light bulb option um i i just
kind of want to emphasize there's many
different types of nuclear rockets
one of them basically fires radioactive
exhaust out the back end of the ship
i don't think that that will ever be
legal
and if that actually is legal um yo
we're definitely the post-apocalyptic
world car scenario
uh where you probably want to get
yourself a mohawk and dune buggy
and uh and recipes for having guests for
dinner
uh it's not gonna be blessed
uh but as for nuclear thermal rockets
maybe i don't think that that's that
would be an option people are too fond
of
and you can use nuclear power to get us
into space um
you know once you're in space you can
use it all you want out of the orbit of
the earth but
near us which you hook a bunch of
nuclear reactors up to
a mass driver a long long trail or an
active support structure
and you power things that way and then
you have a much more contained
place for your uranium which is good to
keep contained i love nuclear power but
it's
not something i want flying over my
house speaking of flying over your house
i see somebody suggest me we need a
space
pony i wonder if they do space sea
horses we did an episode on space whales
oh and and we were just talking about
whale guns a moment ago
um hey hey i see up on the screen we've
got uh the killing stars
episode coming up on march 11th and we
have a question on starlifting
from mercurian brock strone they've got
a very long name
anyway he wants to know if i start
starlifting the iron out of the sun
how many earth mass planets can i fit in
the earth's orbit
and why is no one talking about orbital
rings
uh orbital rings and this is the biggest
one with that um
well in terms of iron avocado let's hit
that first
there's about 27 000 earths worth give
or
take of mass that's not hydrogen helium
in the sun
uh iron should be one of the more
plentiful of those but off the top of my
head i don't know if that would be like
100 earth mass worth or a thousand worth
of mass worth ions are fairly plentiful
isotope
um but i think oxygen would make up the
lion's share of that mass and then
carbon nitrogen and then
i i can't know how many orders of
magnitude drops off between like oxygen
and ion
um but if you look up an elemental
abundance chart
uh just take 27 000 and then look at
what oxygens is compared to iron and
adjust coin um as to
orbital rings the reason why they're not
getting talked about much is one
they're really not that well known yet
and two um
it's kind of like saying that i want to
go settle
um the oregon in
1822 and someone says let's build
ourselves
a big railroad out there let's say bro
to where what city there are no cities
out there it's not even a village
or someone saying i would like to open
up a
you know international airports in the
middle of nome alaska
say well there's only like two or three
people who go there on a given day we
don't need international airport
orbital rings are like that there's a
very heavy capital investment
and what they make cheap is mass motion
of things in space
uh we haven't have a prototype one it's
probably easier to do a lighter one
we've already done a few
right now we're not with the
miniaturization stage with the prototype
at stage
and i don't think we'd even want to be
prototyping something like that until we
were talking about moving at least a
thousand people
to and from space in a given year and
some amounts of calico that's when you
can stop prototyping
matt van grisfen says uh oh thank you
matt for your super chat and he says
have you ever seen a red dwarf and what
do you think
have i ever seen a veg wolf or have i
seen the show red dwarf does it say
let's assume it's the show well assume
for the moment it was a
one of the stars no one has seen a red
dwarf because i don't think any are
actually visible to the naked eye
maybe parks buff you got binoculars so
the show of edgewolf i've seen the first
couple episodes
um i don't know why but every time i
start watching eventual if i end up
watching blake seven instead
i don't know which of the two qualifies
is more dystopian but when it comes to
low budget science fiction from the 70s
and 80s from the bbc
they're both good
[Music]
uh johnny wings thank you for your super
chat he says hey isaac i love your
channel can you tell us about your plans
for the channel and any growth or
developments and what are your goals or
plans for the coming year
uh theoretically we'll have to start a
new studio up in a few months
um and i am hoping to find time to write
a book
uh at some point this year but that's
been slow progress
um and i don't know if that's gonna be
like mega structures or if it's gonna be
on fully paradox or even if i'll get
into my year to just write something
fictional but
not just theoretically if we're moving
to a blueberry farm
then you have to have an office that
accommodates you know eating blueberries
and talking on the channel
i don't know are there blueberries going
to grow in space we actually did that in
the comp zone colonizing series
it's funny you know the one that sean
asked me to do the conference
in mulch the episode he wants to show it
being advanced have you a q a on is that
called nice and serious episode we talk
about blueberry for me
well see they they know that you're uh
wanting to
get into farming and we're farming
blueberries so they want to know if you
can try them out on the moon
there we go a little bit of context when
he was wondering on that
uh see what started a blueberry farm
right before we got married and has been
semi on hiatus this thing all right
we'll
start back up this year
[Laughter]
so in terms of the channel um we're
studying a lot of stuff with nebula
right now with standard
for context standards the uh
guild network kind of thing that a bunch
of us founded a few years back
um and uh it's like real engineering's
on it for instance
uh but you've probably seen a bit
something that we do curiosity stream
we put a lot in trying to expand that
out that's been sucking up a lot of
creative energy
um doing like extended versions things
like that for episodes
um but i'd say probably the biggest one
to try to do with the show
is i'd like to do more live uh follow-up
segments on the videos
at the end of the main ones um as we saw
a couple of those
late and not necessary live but you know
at least
recorded like this kind of situation and
it's everything's on hold while the
plague's on as we say
i don't know uh more live studio stuff
switching around maybe starting some
more work on the book and probably
trying to explore some of the options
for uh
other formats size just youtube so i do
like youtube for those of us who just
talk about like
me and other children said well we're
not too happy with youtube that's what
we don't really want to be strictly
dependent on youtube's our only
you know place to put our videos out at
and so there's been a lot of effort by a
lot of us to explore alternative
platforms and that's taken up a lot of
industry effort of last year or so
uh ram bam says that he and his dad used
to watch
uh like seven as well long time ago oh
yeah i think i might have showed you
episode one of that but it is it the guy
has a poem
uh that's the thing everyone knows his
voice with like seven is the main
character
uh has a giant poem uh
the face of these show um but uh
i guess we have time for one more
question before we go to break yeah well
let's uh ask this question on life
extension here we have will cherry thank
you for your donation will he says what
is the odds
for life extension in the next 50 years
and if it's not possible what are your
thoughts on freezing
or would we have cybernetics by then and
cybernetics doesn't necessarily amount
to life extension thank you by the way
for the donations and i know a couple of
people have done super chat hopefully
it's coming up on the screen when people
aren't doing that
but uh it's very impressive we try to
get everyone's question
that we can to one way or another but
sorry for those we're getting skipped on
that um
cybernetics does not necessarily offer
life extension
um it probably would do a lot for
letting you get
for the long life in good health you
like if your heart's going bad it's nice
to be able to use something cybernetic
but
i think that technologically speaking
more often not what we use is you know
just a cloned human heart a
reconditioned heart or a heart going on
top of a pig's heart
um everybody wants a pig's heart
such a strange thing to think that
that's their closest relative for the
purpose of
organs um anyway um
freezing's an option if you think the
technology is possible
i would tend to feel like if we haven't
made big progress on it in the next 50
years
it might be that turns out to be a lot
harder to crack than we're thinking in
which case freezing might not help as
much as one would hope
but uh i would say that i give us 50 50
odds of having very significant life
extension i put the amazon very
significant because we already have life
extension
uh the number of people who live over 90
compared to when i was a little kid
alone a century ago is ridiculous
number of people who break a hundred is
is used to be one of those things where
maybe one person in the town
turned a hundred uh now it's you there
are multiple people around having that
birthday every year
um all medicine as i'll be degraded
let's say
all medicine is life extension so uh but
if we're not making fast enough progress
for you and me maybe freezing is an
option so
we'll go ahead and go to break and we'll
be back in just a minute
so we'll be on break for a few minutes
and it's a great time to get a drink and
a snack or get more questions in for
part two of our live stream
while we're waiting a couple episodes
back we were looking at orbital
bombardment
and i've gotten asked why we didn't
spend much time talking about using
asteroids as weapons
it's a very popular idea in science
fiction showing up in almost every major
franchise like star trek
star wars star gate babylon 5 and many
more
including most recently the stealth
asteroid attack we see play out in
season 5 of the expanse
however we didn't focus on it too much
in the episode and partially it's
because we've looked at asteroids before
in our asteroid defense episode last
year but mostly because asteroids are
not very good weapons
we could probably do an entire episode
on the topic and maybe will at some
point
but let's just detail the key bits
during our break
first any space-faring civilization
where folks can move around asteroids
it's one way they can also move around
and place a lot of detection gear too
almost every trick for hiding actions in
space relies on either weaker detection
gear or at all being at one single spot
if you want to give an asteroid to shove
one that could usefully damage earth
then you're generally talking about
having to give something in the vicinity
of a trillion kilograms a change of
velocity of a kilometer a second
and that would be a fairly modest
asteroid of less than a kilometer across
that just happened to be a near-earth
orbital path so that it only needed a
minor shove
that's exactly the sort of asteroid
folks most closely would monitor too
for a variety of reasons not least being
collision concerns
so the kinetic energy needed to shift a
trillion kilograms a kilometer per
second design order of a billion billion
joules
that's comparable to a couple hundred
hydrogen bombs
and again that's assuming we're moving a
relatively modest sized asteroid with a
very precision and efficient push
this is not something you could do very
stealthily but the usual notion is that
you'd aim your rocket flame in the
shadow of the asteroid from whoever is
looking at it
pointing away from the planet earth for
instance now a rocket flame that big
is still going to get seen as is a giant
cone
this is literally what a comet is but
even if we assume it hid in the asteroid
shadow
it's only from that one angle and the
first most obvious place to put your
detection gear
is out at places far from earth able to
watch those other angles
i should also note that while it's
essentially a comet it's a very bright
one at that
comets are just the dust and ice melting
off a big icy rock
not a much more powerful rocket flame
trying to seriously change its
trajectory
the other thing to keep in mind is that
in a space-faring civilization
asteroids are seen as wandering money
someone owns them
especially the metallic ones considered
ideal for use as a weapon
they are going to want to track the
things and they are going to be watching
for obvious tricks like someone grabbing
the transponder they left on the surface
of the asteroid detaching it
not for fear of someone using it as a
weapon but an attempt to steal the
asteroid
so hard physical checks by radar and
telescope should be fairly common
fundamentally we want to use an asteroid
as a weapon because it's dropping a
mountain on someone with energy releases
that exceed nuclear bombs
and we have to remember that means
trying to move a mountain without anyone
noticing
while using energy releases equivalent
to nuclear bombs to do it
it's not subtle and it's not something a
space failing civilization is going to
ignore
a mountain full of money that is not
where it's supposed to be
is going to result in folks looking for
it with a lot of enthusiasm and
determination
and the faster you want to move one the
bigger the noise it will make so to
speak
hence they don't make for very good
weapons we'll get back to our show in
just a moment but i want to thank
everyone for their continued support on
patreon and all the wonderful episode
ideas we had there in our recent poll
and if you'd like to help support the
show you can do so on patreon
or by going to the donate tab on our
website isaacarthur.net
and now back to our show
all right and we're back um and by the
way for those who are seniors says
january 31 i guess it didn't get updated
uh we're kind of adjusting to this new
system for
stream labs obs uh we're trying to go by
stream labs obs not its other acronyms
slobs
is the new live streaming software one's
using and i'm getting kind of used to it
so
i'll get back to your questions well
flax decided he wanted to make an
appearance
um so we have a
question here from twilight mists
thank you for the super chat twilight
and they say i love your channel
you've repeatedly said that the ir
signature of a dyson
swarm can't be hidden but hypothetically
couldn't you direct
all of that energy into a shell of black
holes
i'm almost wondering if i should just
put him up on my lap so he's not walking
around by the tripod
um this has been happy a lot i don't
know if he was noticed when we did cam
when i had david swing the camera on
last time i had the clever thought to
put a cat door into my office so my cats
wouldn't be scratching at my door to get
in when they wandered in and
now they can just kind of walk in freely
all the time i think he's going to sit
there and watch because he's very
interested in your answer to the
question about
whether or not you could direct the
energy into the shell of a black hole
hey how can you put me on the screen
this is
it just popped up with me
um there's time lag on your side so this
is flex
all right talking about black holes real
quick um
if you try to direct energy into black
hole it's obviously going to go in there
i think what people tend to forget is
that a black hole is not just something
that sucks up random energy
when a photon for instance is going into
a black hole if it starts off infrared
it's not going to arrive infrared
it's going to be blue shifting the whole
way we do not know for certain that
black holes don't violate
the laws of thermodynamics but we tend
to assume that they do not
the major reason why we don't say for
sure is we can't absolutely rule it out
yet so it's not really one of those
things where we think they might violate
thermodynamics so much as we're not 100
positive that they do not
um everything in nature should give off
radiation black holes give off radiation
in their own way
um and the idea is can i take all that
radiation and can i bounce it down into
a black hole
hypothetically yeah you could maybe be
able to do that you could maybe surround
your civilization with infrared
reflective meals that were parabolic
dishes that just bounce all the light
down
into a black hole into a sequence of
mirrors and lenses
you're not going to hide yourself
completely doing something like that and
you're not going to believe that you
would
right that is not a working way to hide
yourself because that's not going to
hide you from anyone as big as you all
right they'll be able to still see at
the various little bits that are leaking
out from that
uh and it's not going to be an energy
efficient process that lets you reuse
that energy either
but there may be some aspects of black
holes that
kind of let us get around the laws of
thermodynamics but probably not
it's still a popular idea for why that
might be the case though it doesn't hide
you gravitationally either
the don jayvon says could we colonize
pulsar planets
or planets planets orbiting a black hole
planets black hole planets i guess
that'll be can we colonize plants
throughout opening in black hole or
poor soil i notice the flax got away he
doesn't like being on the camera so
maybe he's gonna go leave maybe there
was no reason why you can't colonize a
planet that was around a black hole or
pulsar
um but you got to keep in mind these
things tend to be fairly radioactive
objects
when a supernova goes off it's going to
wreck all the plants that are actually
in the habitable zone there might be
some remnants left over or the bigger
ones a little bit
outweighs because supernovas are very
powerful but plants are
held together pretty good then it's got
a death star everything um
whatever's left over is not very bright
post ozone no indian blight is this
is as the weakest of normal stars right
and black holes are obviously not very
bad at all
so these planets are going to be frozen
and hit by gamma radiation every time
random particle falls by them
they're not places you really want to be
thinking about colonizing your planet
but there's no reason you couldn't
terraform them if you really really
wanted to
just gotta be able to shield them a lot
um more likely you
take them apart use a lot of radiation
shielding and live inside
artificial habitats that you made out of
them igor brisken says what is the
future of salt water
like nuclear isotope infused water
engines in the next 50 years
you know when it comes to any invalid
nuclear fission i i
i don't even like to kind of guess about
what its development or use on earth is
going to be because
first you've got that you've got two
types of resistance here the irrational
and the rational kind
some folks are a little too resistant to
it for the wrong reasons but they're
you know they're well inside the zone of
what's you know
legitimate and so on and other people
who are just convinced it's gonna kill
them period no matter how safe we make
it
i never know how much to factor that
lateral category into
guessing how popular nuclear's gonna get
um
so we might make one that's really
efficient really good uh
has no carbon footprint is a tenth the
price of no more electricity and people
still won't use it
i i don't know we also have to keep in
mind that on the more rational side of
things it's entirely possible we might
just get a better power supply
um you know you can't beat nuclear but
then the sun's nuclear so
you can't really beat a cheap mirror and
some solar panels potentially either
uh i do think there's a very big rule
that
nuclear can be in whether we're talking
small modular reactors smos
or any other variations too um but how
that will get filled up in the next 50
years is just
your guess as good as mine
we have another question here from
matt333 what kind of habitable exoplanet
would be more suitable to humans
a smaller one with oh i'm assuming
that's oxygen
seven to one earth mass or a super earth
with three to four times the mass of
earth and can you explain this please
um
okay so the idea of being here are we
talking about a plant that's
maybe 70 to 100 earth's math versus a
super bowl that's three or four times
the massive wolf
um we're going to find a lot of plants
out there that are very
close to earth's mass but most of them
are not going to be right so the
question is
is something that's lighter than venus
but heavier than mars
more habitable than something that's
three or four times as massive
as earth um and then it kind of depends
on what you mean by habitable
i would guess that it's not going to
take a lot of effort to terraform a
super earth that's actually
very oceanic if it's got land at all and
then it doesn't have to have land you
can
that's you could have submarine
extraction of resources and people
living in
giant ships um but uh
i would say that you probably have an
easier time terraforming one that was
the 7.7 to
1 earth mass region just because
it's harder to maintain an atmosphere in
the long run there but in the long run
uh you're talking millions and millions
of years and if you can
terraform it and you know tens of
thousands of years then you can replace
this atmosphere a few million years if
you need to
so i would say probably easier to set up
and terraform a civilization
on a plant that's a little bit less
massive north and then this
three or four times is massive we have a
super chat here
from joachim heatman how heavy can a
space station become before it affects
earth like a tidal water
and what technologies do we currently
lack to start mining space
thanks can you give it to me one more
time
he said how heavy can a space station
become before
it affects the earth like a tidal water
uh that's actually a decent enough
question because it depends on how much
um tidal forces
the moon obviously has a pretty big
effect on us but to have the same
gravitational force as the moon has an
object that's
200 miles away as opposed to 200 000 in
this case the moon or
you know kilometers uh would need a
millionth of mass people in the same
force because it's a thousandth
resistance
that's not quite how title forces work
it's not quite involve square but think
of it just straight gravitational force
for the moment
and say wow something that's a millionth
the mass of the moon that's in orbit and
low earth orbit would have quite a lot
of tidal force
and say well with an onion cylinder a
millionth of mass the moon
that's a great question um the moon's
mass
is around 10 to 23 kilograms
right or around 10 to 20 tons we usually
think of
a o'neill station as being you know in
the low billions of tons
so you're talking about order of
magnitude difference there of
what 100 billion so a mckendree cylinder
the the big daddy of the o'neill
cylinder probably would begin to have a
noticeable effect on earth if it was in
low to medium orbit but still
pretty minimal um and then just depends
on how thick it is but mckendree
cylinder will mask to have any
real effect galagas the new gulag
says isaac do you have backup copies of
all your videos
i would hate for the algorithm to shut
you down and lose all of that content
forever
this must be in reference to your
comment on youtube earlier
um i think actually i'm bitching but i
know of at least three or four audience
members who do
or at least i've mentioned in the past
they downloaded every video and kept a
copy around
um i do have copies probably of every
video
uh i have three or four versions of some
of them in some cases um
because i tend to be bad about purging
the uh edit versions like
typically these videos one reason they
can come out a couple days early on
nebula
is they come out a week to two weeks
early uh
for our crew good to see them up on
youtube as unlisted videos
and we go through and find all the typos
and then i said if i want to fix the
typos like there's a typo in next week's
video and one
single typo with two letters of
arrangement i'm thinking i'm not sure if
i care enough to spend three hours
fixing that one typo
um but uh your wife who reads and edits
things
cringes yeah every typo is worth fixing
every typo keith blockus and jerry go
and he both piper recognizes eddos they
tend to be the ones who catch all the
typos on the videos and
if there's a lot of them or to go back
and change something else i'll go fix
them but in this case it's like if it's
a missing period or two letters
rearranged i tend to
be a bit more relaxed but there's copies
of pretty much every video out there if
one or two has gotten lost
the scripts are out there i i know it
sounds weird but
if you're the one who's actually making
episodes or making a series or making a
book you tend to be a lot less attached
to the originals
than a lot of your audience is because
to you they all have three or four
different draft versions
so but yes there's backup stuff like
that
dan the warlock hey i was so impressed
by your video on hive minds i was
wondering about
if it could be possible to even create
one with technology
and if yes humanity would be truly
united correct
that's such an interesting way of
calling it united oh
uh if you have i mean if we're talking
like a borg style hive mind from star
trek
then that's no unity what's really want
to be part of um
i always think of like the example of
gaia from isaac asthma's foundation
series where it's a planet-wide hive
mind where it's not just the people
it's like the animals and even 200
degrees the plants and the rocks
and um i don't want to be part of one
the main character
that golden trees doesn't want to be
part of one either um i don't know why
you
would want to be part of a high mind of
that variety but
as to a networked intelligence that's
the difference we already
network intelligence is to a limited
degree it just depends on how you know
that line between your person this and
somebody else's person is getting out of
blood
would we be unified i suppose so um
that's not necessarily a good thing
though it depends on how it's done
suet kumar says can we colonize global
clusters um
there's no reason why we couldn't but
you're getting kind of
hesitant to really say at that point
you'd want to do natural planets
for those who don't know a globular
cluster is usually a group of oral stars
but it's pretty packed there's a key
thing there is it's very packed with
stars
there you know it's not spacing only
four light years it might be spacing of
every four light months or even less um
they are they are old big systems full
of light
um i don't know that i might be putting
plastic especially since it's being
going red giant in the case of red
globular crystals um
could you actually fill the yoyo out
with things like space habitats
absolutely yeah
um the biggest trick is planets are
always be a little bit
sensitive to radiation lighting beyond
what you'd have for
if i have a meter thick of dirt steel
and lead treat me in it
because i'm inside of space habitat so
yes
but probably not the place you want to
be terrifying plants a lot
the game crasher the master gamer says
have you heard of the channel
astronauts x they're saying that
essentially faster than light travel
is not only possible but necessary for
the universe to function
um i haven't holded their channel
so i don't know what they actually said
on that for all i know they're making
the reference that you actually well
uh we say fast night travel is
impossible and then we turn around and
say that
almost everything in the universe that
we can see is moving away from us faster
than the speed of light
and so that's interesting so you can't
go fast and light but almost everything
in the universe is going away from us
faster than light
so yes that's how that whole expansion
of the universe thing walks
um so they might be talking about that
kind of context
otherwise i don't know it might be some
new theory they're familiar with i don't
know how you never get fast and light
travel between two places
to work like that though um there's a
lot of theories
they also do a lot of things that don't
exist like negative matter which again
negative matter looks great on people
but so does a negative bucket of water a
negative one dollar bill things like
that i don't know how you would hand
people these things
how do you handle me a negative gallon
of water or a negative liter or a
negative pound
so if we do develop faster than light
travel brian wants to know if we could
travel far enough away from
our planet to look back and witness
every single event in history at real
time
yeah if you can do this impossible thing
then you have the ability to do that
although i should point out that it's
really hard to see
things on planets far away uh keep in
mind
all spy satellites are not on the moon
you can't see the surface of the moon
you can't see the moon lander
uh with the biggest telescopes we have
on this planet all
spy satellites are like 100 miles up in
the air uh 100
200 kilometers right 160 kilometers in
that case
um they're not high they're not far away
they are a thousand times closer to us
than the moon is
alternatively if you want to see the
history of the earth from where the moon
is that's three
like a second and a half ago one half
seconds back one time
see four light years away you talk about
being able to see
the detail of a human on the surface of
planet through the clouds through all
the distortion through all the other
things
with the telescope four light years away
then you'd be able to talk about a
telescope that has actually got a lens
bigger than a planet and we discussed
those options and mega telescopes but
that story took you four light years
back you probably have pretty good
history recording by the time you're you
know
building plant-sized telescopes so what
you mean is i want to see a hundred
thousand years back or a million light
years back
and say okay then you need to be talking
about building telescopes who have
lenses bigger than galaxies in
those cases and i don't think that you'd
really be able to see
even then this is not something you
should be able to pull off but it's
theoretically possible
if you could do those two impossible
things patrick mccarthy says
over time i've had time to think about
the colonization of
space via o'neill cylinders and the like
and he feels that it's a better option
for colonizing planets especially
regarding the availability of resources
you've touched on this a little bit
before but would you like to add any
comments
um i think of itself it's it's that's i
agree
i think there's always going to be
desire for some people to have the
classic physical planet
uh i think there'll be people who want
to do showboards too and there's room
for that you know artificial shell
boards
are definitely a possibility using if
you can either control dark matter or
you just have a lot of hydrogen you want
to store around because the shell wall
doesn't use up that much mass of the
rocky hard expensive kind and you do
want to be storing mass around so why
not take advantage of it you know if
your economy runs on black hole power
sources
you might as well stick a planet around
it makes it easier to guard your
vote and black holes make very good
volts
um but uh
as to why you would ever colonize or
tear for a planet
people will i don't doubt that but it's
a good way to stick a claim to it
because what you're really doing
in this case is saying i'm lenny on this
planet that represents like one percent
of the available mass in the solar
system that's mine
and if you guys want it you have to
you're taking from our civilization
so not a bad position to be in from an
economic or political perspective i
suppose but
it's always going to be easier to do it
on the other side obviously a lot mass
cheaper too
hidden says how does location within a
galaxy affect star or planet formation
matter distribution and more broadly the
likelihood of intelligent life
how does star formation location within
a galaxy
affect star or planet formation matter
distribution
and more broadly the likelihood of
intelligent life there's still a lot of
debate about exactly what the metalistic
of the early galaxy looked like and what
its distribution
is but the if the closer you are to the
center of the galaxy the younger the
stuff tends to be the further out y'all
the older it tends to be
on average very loosely speaking this
does not mean stars are formed
in the center of the galaxy and work
their way out uh metallicity-wise the
more supernovas you have in the area
the more recently that is the higher the
concentration of metallic
objects but for the most part uh
other than the very early universe which
don't have a good image for you at the
first four or five billion years
you really should have the option to
have rocky plants of earth mass almost
anywhere in the galaxy
some places obviously more distributed
than others and that one you would have
to talk to an astronomer on because i do
not know what the
current models were saying about um
metallicity of
of systems based on distance or nebular
clusters of that
period
okay well speaking of pulsar albert has
a question would non-carbon life forms
be able to survive on a pulsar planet
and if so what type of biochemistry
would be best suited to
survive the heavy radiation
i can't answer the first question
because we don't know what
non-carbon-based life actually looks
like so we couldn't say that it could
live there or couldn't live there
um nothing should like radiation that's
based on chemistry
so we're talking about non-calm based
life but still assuming chemistry
there's presumably certain chemistries
that would be a little bit more
resistant to radiation but if it's
ionizing radiation
if it's your hard uv your x-ray or your
gamma the stuff you get off of pulsars
it's going to rip molecules apart it's
going to damage anything sophisticated
based on chemistry
after that it's hard to say you know
maybe something that was silicon based
but didn't you actually
really go for chemistry so much as a
crystal instructor or semiconductor
structure they might be able to do it
um and
yeah that's i mean so chemistry-wise the
relation would be a syllabus it's really
more
more suited to those kind of systems it
just shouldn't be a place you'd expect
life to be able to evolve
using chemistry dj brower wants to know
what your thoughts on
interplanetary cyclers and how feasible
they would be in the next 30 years
okay as a part of that do you have
thoughts on elon musk and his 1 million
people on mars by 2050
i love that man he's uh every time i
think he's got an idea that's completely
crazy that's the one that works out
um i have a personal rule where elon
musk is concerned that dates back to me
being one of the people who thought
spacex was never going to go anywhere
uh i don't take forgiveness elon musk
can pull things off because he fails
more often he succeeds or things like
this
uh and yet he has his success ratio that
uh even thomas edison would find
impressive
um so he might be able to pull that off
mike's a big point though because mr
dodo has a good point here he says
considering that we don't have a
permanent base on the next rock along
from us the moon
what are the chances of us colonizing
another planet or interstellar within
the next 1000 generations
we could colonize mars
in this decade if we want it too bad
enough and we're going to throw enough
money at it and we're going to take some
risks with using some prototype engines
right it's it's it can be done um we
could set one up on the moon too if you
willing to just throw money at it um
and the thing is why would you need a
million people there though if you're
just trying to do the get your eggs out
of one basket scenario
you can do that with a thousand people
an awful lot of freezers full of uh
genetic material
i mean i would love to
be around here in 2050 when i guess i'd
be what 70.
i would love to be here in 2050 and say
yeah i can't believe it but musk was
right and there's a million people on on
mars
so we have another question related to
that million people on mars someone says
wouldn't that be death by gravity
we don't know that or by lack of gravity
yeah i mean see our life on low gravity
plants
episode or the more recent zero gravity
civilizations episodes
but what we discussed there is we don't
know what low gravity does people we
just don't know we know what zero
gravity or microgravity does people
um but we've never put people in low
gravity with uh with exactly 12
exceptions
right we've had 12 men who walked on the
moon for
three days or so each right booking on
those trips they were undergoing high
acceleration and no gravity
right so for the three days of low
gravity each of those experienced we
have no data
because it was bookended by zero gravity
and high acceleration gravity and
re-entry
and they were in perfect health and it
was three days we do not know that
twelve percent of gravity like the moon
has
is in any way home for the humans we
think it probably is not
healthy but we don't know and there's a
lot of guesswork on that
moles is three times higher gravity and
a little under half what we have
that might turn out to be perfectly fine
it might be one of those things where
you don't even really need to do extra
exercise
but we would expect it to be causing
some fluid issues causing some damage to
bone structural from density
but it might not be anything that we
can't easily fix so thunder blitz says
if we found a way to produce wormholes
cheaply
could a type 3 civilization exist by
reducing data travel time
sure
again that's the one horse thing if you
can make stargate style wormholes
um then yes you could absolutely run
yourself a galactic empire
um you'll see some examples like well
like stargaze or like peter hamilton's
commonwealth saga
um for just a few examples of really
good wormhole
based galaxy wide civilizations uh
but there's a galaxy there's a wormhole
in science fiction which is a flat disc
that you can walk through and step out
the other side of the universe
and there's a one hole in actual
mathematical modeling
which is something that weighs several
hundred
solar masses that's that's the basic
worm wall of the original model it
weighed
more than several hundred stars stuff
together and that was making a gateway
big enough for a person or ship to get
through
we have some concepts where you might be
able to do like a single jovian mass
and some others that fool around with
negative mass that might let you do a
bit less than that but these are still
gigantic things and um
they they are not necessarily going to
you get them to walk
really be ideal for casual commerce and
communication
i was just reading through some of the
comments here we have uh
al goren dianza says isaac arthur love
the channel it makes me happy seeing you
and your wife working together it's so
cute
thank you thank you when i actually
remember to switch the camera to my wife
uh
it's uh um
that wasn't a question that was a
comment it was just a comment
yeah it's awesome i i do have a couple
more questions here though right before
we
sign off for the afternoon i think we
should probably show it soon
okay mr kavinsky says hey arthur if
humanity and aliens come to blows
wouldn't the ort
be perfect spot for them to gather
resources and strength
maybe even weaponize the asteroids that
barely pass by the earth
the old cloud oort
what cloud well they don't say cloud but
that probably is what they meant
um uh if aliens are going to attack us
the oort cloud would be a perfect place
for them to land if they're trying to be
stealthy about it
um the problem is right now if aliens
will come into the system and they want
to attack us
they it's not where they would stop it's
where they would dump their garbage out
um if you're traveling between solar
systems at a knee fraction speed of
light the best way to deal with a
hostile planet
that you're traveling to is to slow down
slightly
right after you keep your garbage out
the airlock in the direction of that
planet
and then wait patiently before the plant
just has the surface get
obliterated by the garbage you could
down to the side then you can invade
um your cloud would be a good place to
sneak a little sulfur green
item in you could go hide inside the ice
where it'd be fairly cool and
eat the inside of a lot of comets or
cometary valleys things like that build
you up a nice size fleet and then you
could
rain steel down on the uh the planet
below
uh inside that solar system so it's not
a bad place to go because you would have
problems seen in there
so we got time for another question all
right we're going to end with one from
atlas he says isaac could batman beat
the predator in a fight
i mean batman beats superman a fight
oh it's schwarzenegger well actually i
don't think it would be fair to say owen
sportsman go beat the predator fight uh
that was
kind of more like survived a fight with
the federal um
i would say batman would would be the
predator yes um
because our sportsnake was awesome but
the pedal is batman's cooler
um yes batman would win
so there we have it official on that
note we'll go ahead and sign out for
today we will see you all on thursday
thank you so much for joining us
good night
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook
reddit discord or our website
isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
