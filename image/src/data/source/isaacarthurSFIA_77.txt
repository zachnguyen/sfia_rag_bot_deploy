Best known from the Orion Drive designs from half 
a century back, pulsed nuclear spacecraft take  
advantage of the sheer power density of atomic 
energy to quickly propel spacecraft to very  
high speeds. In its most basic conceptual form, 
the ship is driven by a large and robust pusher  
plate mounted on a spring behind the main body of 
the ship. Every time a pulse is produced - by the  
detonation of a nuclear device - the pusher 
plate is slammed forward into the spring,  
which slowly relaxes tha momentum into the 
ship’s main body for a smoother acceleration. 
These may be very tiny devices of 
under a kiloton of explosive power,  
or even smaller if we are using more exotic 
fissiles or antimatter-catalyzed fusion. It may  
also include far larger and likely more efficient 
fusion bombs, in the case of truly enormous ships,  
and would permit a large colony ark ship to 
travel at modest interstellar speeds without any  
new science or engineering. See our episode A New 
Dawn for more discussion of this type of drive.
