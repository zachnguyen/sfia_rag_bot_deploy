Computronium is a catch-all term from speculative
science and scifi for any type of matter which
supports computation or thought.
While human brains classify as computronium,
the intent is usually to describe substances
designed to maximize computation, and usually
very large objects dedicated to this goal.
Earth for instance is only 2 parts per quadrillion
human brain, so a planet-sized brain would
have 500 trillion times the brains of the
entire human race combined, and possibly far
greater if you had a form of computronium
vastly superior to a human neuron.
We can contemplate entire planets or star
systems turned into vast computers, such as
a Jupiter Brain or Matryoshka Brain, able
to tackle impossible mysteries or simulate
whole universes and emulate trillions of trillions
of people living inside them.
A post-biological civilization might seek
to turn all matter in the Universe into computronium,
possibly via a hegemonizing swarm, see Matryoshka
Brains for more details.
