Quasar Cannon.
 A Quasar is a quasi-stellar object many times brighter than an entire galaxy,   
often radiating more power 
than a Quadrillion normal stars,  
and releasing a billion-billion-billion times more 
power every second than a megaton thermonuclear  
bomb. Quasars are less common nowadays, as we 
believe they are caused by large quantities of  
matter falling into supermassive blackholes in 
a core of a younger and more turbulent galaxy. 
It should be possible to set off such an 
event artificially, or even use a smaller  
blackhole to generate the effect, such as 
we believe causes gamma ray bursts. Much  
as we convert an entire star into a giant 
death ray, as with the Nicoll-Dyson Beam,  
it should be possible to create a quasar cannon 
around a blackhole that had a more focused and  
targetable gamma ray beam potentially 
millions to trillions of times more  
destructive than even a Nicoll-Dyson Beam.
For more examples of such megastructures,  
like the Quasar Drive, see our 
episode, the Megastructure Compendium.
