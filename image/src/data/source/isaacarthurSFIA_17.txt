The Medusa Drive is a variation of Pulsed 
Nuclear Drives that use small atomic fission  
or fusion bombs to drive the ship. The Medusa 
Drive replaces the traditional pusher plate  
behind the ship we see on designs like the 
Orion Drive with the equivalent of a large,  
thin parachute in front of the ship. A 
sail assembly connected to the ship by  
a very long tether is shoved forward by 
detonating nuclear bombs inside the sail,  
this shoves the sail forward, which then drags 
the ship along by the tethers, rather than shoving  
the plate forward to push the ship from behind. 
This permits you to use less radiation shielding,  
and place it up front where it will protect 
against the interstellar gas, dust, and radiation,  
saving total mass for the ship. As the sail gets 
damaged it can be winched back in for repair  
or recycling. It could also be deployed behind 
to help slow the ship later, or be used as the  
sail of a pushing beam system. See the Advanced 
Spaceship Drive Compendium for more discussion.
