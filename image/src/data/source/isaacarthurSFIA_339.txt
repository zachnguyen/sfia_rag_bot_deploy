good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others we
usually go for about an hour
so you probably want to grab a drink and
a snack though we'll take a break about
halfway through
too with all that said welcome and let's
get started
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
our monthly live stream q a
we'll get start with your questions in
just a moment in the chat window uh as
usual we'll be taking questions from the
audience as we go along we have a couple
to start off with from last month so
that people got in early
and as usual be joined by my wife today
asking questions
the honorable sir lane fowler ortho
oh my goodness so much fluff
so um this is a gorgeous spring day at
least here in northeast ohio we had a
chance to go bicycling yesterday
that's a good hobby if you haven't
gotten to enjoy the good weather
if you're in an area that's having good
weather then by all means do so
after today's live stream which will run
for about an hour
yeah i'm jealous it rained this morning
and now that we could actually go
bicycling we have a live stream and
we're trapped indoors
but it does raise an interesting
question to start us off with and that
is
can we go bicycling on the moon can we
go bicy on the moon
yeah what would it be like to ride a
bicycle on the moon
that's actually a good question um the
biggest problem people tend to have
uh with gravity is thinking well there's
only like only about a third of the
gravity you normally have on earth
is eight or seventh graph you have an
earth on the moon and um
you just say it's a little bit like
being in water in terms of how fast you
sink
but it's also a little bit like you know
like in water because hard to move
as close to air when you are on the moon
your
gravitational mass has dropped but your
inertial mass the same has always been
um you know uh you are still being
slowed down by trying to move your arms
around in a 100 pound spacesuit so
you could bicycle on the moon you'd have
very little air resistance
trying to pedal in one of those space
suits that we have these days would
probably make you
uh really feel the workout uh there's
some great
slopes on the moon everything's really
sharp your wheels would pop almost
instantly
oh man so i need to work on some sort of
new
tires definitely yeah if you had some
really good tires uh and a space suit
that didn't uh
feel like you're wearing a hundred pound
sack um
then the moon would be one of those
places you could bike really really well
on
i don't think i want to carry a hundred
pound sack with my hundred pound frame
so all right nicely on the moon very
different experience sounds like it
well we had a question here from adrian
burchell from the moon to mars he says
if the mars expedition discovers
evidence of life in the past such as a
statute or building
or obvious manufactured construction
would nasa tell us
would nasa tell us that they discovered
aliens or ancient aliens on mars
um although of course people say no they
might be aliens it's a popular thing
from science fiction like uh in some
novels it turns out not to be aliens
it's future humans or
ancient humans futures yeah but if we
find ancient buildings on mars
or things along those lines wouldn't ask
to tell us
yes and and the major reason i would say
that is because well there would always
be folks who say
maybe we should investigate small scale
folks or get more determination on it
every single time nasa or one of the
affiliate groups has come up with
something that thought might
have an outside chance of being aliens
they couldn't wait to tell us it was
like the first thing that popped out of
their mouth
and they said well not saying it's
aliens yeah yeah
so um you know the the zero joke is that
the the united states government leaks
like a sieve
and the scientists are even worse
academia can't keep a secret despair's
life so
you beauty about it well from the mars
let's go to
stars we have a question from chris
leach hey isaac wondering which of the
nearby stars you think would be the best
candidates to colonize
i've noticed tascenty and epsilon erdani
come up a lot in sci-fi
um i think tao city and don't quote me
on this wikipedia is better for that um
towson is about 12 light years away so
it's one of the biggest star systems
near us
there are like 50 stars about that same
distance from small red dwarfs
um and then epsilon earth down is within
about 20 light years and they're very
popular in science fiction for that
reason because there are
stars around which we would reasonably
expect to find plants that are
earth-like
as a possibility we'd expect them to
have solar systems we'd expect them to
have habitable zones and last long time
and i can't remember but one of those
two is like seven billion years old or
is that the estimate of it
um so there are good places to consider
looking for it i think we did one of
those as the
location or episode dead aliens like
four or five years ago so
and uh there was a puzzle dean of that
that i think we only had one person ever
actually successfully solved in an
episode for that alien so
we have a question from crack quaxton
what do you think about the future of
virtual reality and the theory that it
might be one of the great filters
sorry what was the difference quack
we quack has the most interesting names
uh what's the questioning in virtual
reality
what do you think about the future of
virtual reality and the theory that it
may
be one of the great filters um i mean
we've talked about that before in
episodes like vulture awards or
a virtual reality in the fermi paradox
episodes the
big issue with virtual reality is uh one
it's slower to develop than i think
anyone thought it was you know if you
were in the 80s that was there was a lot
of people predicting it then in the 90s
there were tv shows about
it and there really wasn't that big gap
between uh what we think was really good
virtual reality like your holodeck from
star trek
uh and what we tend to have nowadays
which is i think it's fairly awesome i
got an oculus rift sent to me by the
developers
and um i got nauseous using the thing in
something called air call plus i'd wear
contact lenses so i don't use my voice
reality
very often but it's really good very
much better stuff than 90s
so it could be addictive you know if we
get even just a little bit better
yeah oh absolutely i mean pong if you
have a pong from like 1980
that was addictive you know of course
virtual reality could be addictive many
things are but
uh life is pretty addictive um would it
be something that actually
causes civilizations to collapse
possibly um it depends on how folks are
using it but
here's the big thing to keep in mind for
a lot of folks it would never be a good
substitute
for the real deal until it was so good
that you hear you're in conversations
with uh
non-humans that ai that were good enough
to be able to sit down
chat with you or do other things with
you um and
uh if you can do that then you can make
a robot
that's smart enough to go and mine an
asteroid and one that's smart enough to
go to another
solar system and mine an asteroid and
when it's smart to do that and build a
copy of itself
so it's not a ban on on going forward
into space before you have the
technology make virtual reality good
enough that people might decide they're
going to live
entirely in virtual reality uh even a
large portion let alone all of them
you already have the technology to
colonize the galaxy with robots alone
who can bring resources home to you to
ever expand your gigantic virtual
reality mainframes
such being the case that does not make
for a very good for me paradox
clatus223 says isaac which technology do
you think will be the first to get a
large amount of people
in space
force technology to get a lot of people
into space rocketry
okay which technology is gonna be the
thing that makes us go into space
um my two really big ones that i tend to
think is the kickstarters the ones that
cause us to go
up there in big numbers and keep in mind
i think we're gonna get there regardless
just as
is cars get cheaper and technology gets
better
as we're seeing with things like spacex
and reusable rockets um
give enough time we will get our
presence up there this is gonna go on so
but what can kickstart a big expansion
quickly
and my two cans had all um asteroid
mining
because it's nice to bring golden and
platinum home to earth and to have the
metals right there
in space to build with uh as well as
moon mining operations
uh and then the other one is power
satellites it's a multi-trillion dollar
industry the energy industry
and that is going to be your best place
to get energy in truth it's actually
better than fusion if you're trying to
avoid overheating a planet
so microwave transmission of power beams
down to earth from power satellites
or mining asteroids for fun and profit
are my two big ones i think will get us
into space sooner than later
zachary bush says hey isaac do you think
humans would colonize the entire
universe and what ways do you think we
can survive
heat death to colonize the entire
universe would require fast light travel
um because there's bits of it that we
can't even see right now at least we
assume we can't see because they're
moving away from us
too fast for the light from them to ever
reach us and most universe that we can
see right now
actually is moving away from us faster
than the speed of light right now
so our joke is that nothing moves faster
than the speed of light except 99 of
reality
so um we would need a fashion light
means of travel we're not going to get
that i don't think but if we did that
would be how you'd have to do that in
order to actually catch to those places
uh or something equivalent to you know
your hype or spaces that let you move
around
space you know faster light effectively
um as to uh how we'd avoid the heat
death we have a good episode on that a
postponing heat death and then a whole
civilization theater time series
and uh those will give you a lot more
details we can go into right now today
but
the short form is you've got to decide
are you interested in preserving humans
after that
in a classic sense or uh is is the mind
what really matters
so we have a question on technological
singularity
says technological singularity with
animal gupta
in what way can humans survive in a dark
era
when there are only particles um
i think it might be a channel actually
the technology quantum circulate with
amphigupta
but uh question how do we live in new
york where there's only
dark particles you have to find
somewhere to interact them you have to
be able to build out of them
or you know gain power off them uh
and that's pretty much what it comes
down to either you have to be able to
build out of them or you have to get
energy out of them if you can't do both
of those
then you can't survive right that
doesn't necessarily mean you have to be
able to support
organic life of them maybe everyone's on
a computer but
that's the key thing whatever those
particles are in terms of makeup you
have to be able to actually manipulate
them and you have to be able to get
energy
world will bass one any ideas on how
fusion could be implemented with ram or
scramjets
um it'll be nice to be able to do fusion
you have very high powered fusion
to actually be advanced be like a ram or
scramjet they have the
one idea um you know the scramjet we
looked at that in our was it's a
beamed power spacecrafts episode as a
way of doing uh space planes was
followed to our space planes episode
where we suggested that we could
potentially use beam power to run a
scramjet
they suck up energy incredibly and say
well this is supposed to be very
sophisticated engine these scramjets no
it's a it's big
we call it a stove pipe for a reason
it's really simple all it does is let
air on one side
super heat that air and shoot out the
back so a microwave or could be made by
basically just taking a material
which uh is absorbent to microwaves you
hit it with microwaves or beams and it
heats up the air as it goes through and
that's
literally it that is a scramjet um the
geometry matters but it is a
mechanically stupidly simple device
right
uh but it uses a lot of energy and thus
would be very nice to have fusion to run
that
but i i think you need to have some kind
of bizarre magnetic field that ran all
your particles through there while it
was
super hot moving things through that
doesn't really strike me as the most
viable approach but
you can get fusion working and compact
fusion working then there's probably no
particular reason why you couldn't get
one inside
of an engine like that to heat it up um
and
uh you always prefer to actually have
the power generation's heat
doing the actual work of heating up air
or rocket thrust in the case like that
because otherwise you're
losing all that heat is being produced
by it to run through electricity to run
a heater on the other end it's it's an
extra step and loses power
all right we have a question here from
jujuber memes do you think
that a birch planet is possible
uh yes i mean that's for those who don't
know the bulge planet is kind of your
ultimate in shell awards paul bulge was
one of our favorite futures he passed
away
um and he gave a lot of the fascinating
ideas we look at things like how to
colonize venus
and he suggested that you could build a
gigantic shell horde around uh the black
holes the centers of galaxies
and we we got on discussing that for
make also these would be things that had
um you know surface areas a billion
times what earth has because they are
you know they're almost a million times
more massive than our sun in three cases
which itself would allow a shell water
almost a million times more massive and
we said well if that
that kind of make a planet those the
notches but around normal black hole but
when these mega black holes
how big could you make that go so the
smaller the bulge player is what he
originally suggested then we say how big
could you go with that and we worked it
out to be something like for an earth
mass you could take it out to about you
know i can't if it was two light years
i'll point you like yours and radius
see our episode uh maker for discussion
of what that
actually is um but that's about your max
on that could you do it
yeah i mean under known physics you
could would you ever do it
uh i hard to say but it's physically
possible it doesn't violate you know
rules this is a shell war that would
have a surface area
a quint well it is true dyson sphere
with a dysonsphere is to earth i think
about a billion billion
billion times the surface area of earth
so that's a bulge plant
question from peter thurlow will
aircraft or other airborne units like
the perseverance drone
have a place on other worlds
um probably i mean you need some air to
run
fixed wings or helicopters but uh
it's not necessarily about the density
of the air that factors in these things
but
you couldn't really run one of these
things on the moon for instance um
you have to go pretty fast in some cases
but you can actually have aerodynamics
even in deep space you know if you're
getting closer to the speed of light
the neo vacuum of interstellar space
will start to act like
uh an atmosphere or these start to act
like air there's no gravity pointing to
the direction that's gonna give you that
lift up and down kind of thing
um but uh you have aerodynamics in in in
super relativistic hyper relativistic
vessels um
but uh will we be using them on those
smaller moons yeah
uh on the bigger moons yeah we use them
on venus oh yeah yeah absolutely
will we use them on any of the gas
giants yes so we'll see
lots of aircraft in our future yeah
b gurglie says do you think the james
webb space telescope will be launched
this year
i'd be happy if it was launched this
century
i you know it's there there are two
events that i do not
ever waste time guessing dates for over
their release
one is the james webb telescope and the
other is uh george r martin's next book
uh
winds of winter expected sometime 2050.
so
no i don't know a question from
innocuous remark
after the other galaxies have receded
from our supercluster
and the cmb has stretched too far to
measure
could the expanding nature of the
universe be rediscovered
so around 100 billion years from now
according to court theory the only
the only thing that would be left for us
to see would be the vague ghosty
remnants of galaxies as radio telescope
blobs uh they'd be that red shifted and
shifting everywhere to the point that
you're probably
not even going to see them beat the cmb
levels um they'd be
very redshifted uh long before that in
the next three to 20 billion years all
the galaxies in our local group that are
still gravitationally bound to us
they're not expanding away
should have collapsed into one big mega
galaxy with some satellite effects
uh and that if you were to have life pop
up inside one of those
inside all these little clusters where
they're just that last gravitationally
stuck together bit
and everything around them is a huge
massive empty universe around them
far bigger than we're in right now we
just get some radio waves still
not even disownable at that point would
you know about the expanding nature of
the universe or would you just know
here's my big clump
um and the answer is yes it would not be
as obvious
you probably wouldn't discover for quite
a while um especially given that your
civilization didn't pop up till the
100 billion you're probably not the
fastest folks out there
um but they still have the occasional
ejected star or the occasional injected
cluster or neutron star or even black
hole with lots of gas around it that
would be
falling outside that area where the dark
energy was still able to push it far
away
so you would see that expansion and you
should be able to figure out from that
and the remnant signals have redshifted
things that yes the universe had been
expanding
question from amelia eslante and thank
you for your
donation amelia greetings isaac what do
you think about
eric lentz and his non-negative warp
drive
um
i'm not as familiar with it as i should
be to answer this question so i'm going
to
limit response on this uh i will say the
first by usually on this is
if you want to create a warp drive on
the current theories you need to have
either negative matter or negative
energy which are arguably the same thing
um on paper this then works but
i think we actually just talked about
this the other day uh what is two minus
negative two
and we say well okay well that's that's
four right it's two minus a negative
number that's that's four
say good that works on paper i can
put a cookie into a cookie jar and say
that i've just stolen
a negative cookie from that jar oh we're
not talking negative numbers again are
we
we actually yes oh man
these work on paper in practice you're
not gonna get somebody convicted of
having stolen a native cookie from a
cookie jar
you're not going to find a negative cup
of coffee it's an accounting and math
track
uh so we have various types of wormholes
uh being stabilized by negative matter
when we have various types of warp
drives that rely on
native cups of coffee negative cookies
uh negative chocolate
negative chocolate too but again i'm all
in favor of you giving me negative
chocolate
you are maybe i was taking your
chocolate away from you no you said it
would mean that i put some in
no no if i if i gave you negative
chocolate that would be i was stealing
your chocolate oh no you can't do that
okay all right
so i can steal your negative chakras the
point being that this is
is logically not not viable you know it
works on math does not work
in reality all the time at least you
steal my chocolate and i'm going to come
get you
and thus being the case i don't tend to
be a big fan
of star wars
and we've had star wars yeah that's rito
um i'm not a big fan of negative
matter-based systems
for any type of portion uh if there is
one and i've heard folks talk about ways
that might get around either using
negative matter or negative energy
i'm not familiar enough to discuss
what's with those but i generally
mathematically you do have to have that
negative in there to ground light speed
which is why some people say
this probably ain't happening so with
this at all be related we have a
question from cozy high
also thank you for their contribution
why haven't we used
sled launch assist to space
sounds like what your mom wants for her
bicycle
sled launch assist well mass drivers in
general right um we want to go land
folks on the moon a parallel to that is
we want to go
send somebody down to the south pole or
plant a flag on the north pole mount
everest
i don't want to move a hundred people up
there i don't want to move a hundred
people there every day i don't want to
move mega tons of cargo back and forth
there we start talking about any of the
things that involve the large
infrastructure sleds you know your mass
driver
that tends to be where that comes in
because humans can only handle so much
acceleration
especially for more than a few seconds
right we could probably push somebody up
at 20 g
for a minute without killing them but
that's getting iffy to get somebody up
to speeds that would get them into space
you know we accelerate those rockets
going to space at like 45 g for a minute
to get them up to the right speed that's
rough on someone and they also cover
hundreds of kilometers to get to that
speed so when we start talking about
these launch systems require you to run
down a rail which i'm very fond of mass
drivers as an example
you're looking at a lot of
infrastructure it's the equivalent of
trying to say
i want to go explore mount everest so i
will build a railroad track
up to the summit so i can go up there
and see what's there it's it's
something you do down the road okay
zachary asks what are your thoughts
about the photos from the rover
on mars that show fossil looking things
and artificial looking things
on mars um you know you'd have to
probably narrow down which specific
event you're pointing to unless this has
been a new one
in the well if there's been one the last
week i haven't heard about it
we went back yeah it was a really good
weather we
were on vacation um
but uh there's always sightings of this
or that on mars in terms of what it is
and it is possible that some of these
things could turn out to be fossils
but none of them really hit that line
yet again
if we should always work on the
assumption that if we think it's life it
probably isn't my usual philosophy is
that
if something is life or if something is
a sign of intelligence especially
you're going to know you're not going to
be arguing about it you know if a flying
saucer lands on the front lawn
and green dudes get out from it and you
track them coming down through the sky
no one's beating them going well they
might be a hoax someone might raise that
later obviously
it's maybe it was a hoax but no if a
mother ship 100 miles across
lands in our upper atmosphere and it's
sitting there standing down at us no
one's gonna be like
that might be a natural phenomena so i
tend to take the viewpoint that with any
phenomena always investigate them more
but you know especially if we think
there's a sign of artificiality or life
about them but
don't get your hopes up because odds are
if it was the real deal
you know thank you the last roman for
your 10
donation he says hey arthur your buddy
thomas here do you think the discovery
of new extraterrestrial fern and fauna
will alter our physiological
way physio physiology the way that the
colombian exchange did all right i was
away we discovered any extraterrestrial
floor
uh do i think oh do you think i
discovered if it would okay
um no not so much i saw a poll
like two decades ago that that asked
people they thought that there was
alien life out there and more than half
response said yes
right um the real deal is obviously a
lot more shocking than the hypothesis of
it but
um we were talking about cultural
effects really slamming people yes
that's going to be a real thing but
we get those all the time you know uh
finding out that there was alien life
and on nearby planet
isn't going to shock us for the reading
life elsewhere it's going to shock us in
how it's set up
it's going to be all the little things
that come along with it right
you're not really being surprised as a
civilization when you've been living on
ireland and somebody shows up from
foreign island and it's something like
wow they sure buy metal ships that's
shocking you're surprised by all the
little things like
microwave ovens or radios that you've
never heard of before and how they
change your life
so we have a dobrev thank you for your
generous contribution he says i'm
re-watching expanse now i don't consider
it likely that there would be human
minors
thank you finally what do you think
about it
i agree wouldn't robots be
so advanced that you simply don't need
any human manual workers and i'm just
going to add the part where that guy's
poor hand gets cut off and they redo it
why wouldn't they want to use a robot a
lot less risky
totally agree with the question i don't
i don't disagree sarah is still new to
science fiction that likes to talk to
the shows and guess what's going on uh
we've been watching season 2 of star
trek next generation the last couple
days too so
not one of the best seasons sally um
oh my um would you actually have human
minors
yes and i'll say why you would have hear
milos do we have human phone walls
yes how many people are actually
dragging a plow to hoe through their
lawn
quite a lot of people actually i don't
mean third world countries either
i have a hoe and you know that's in the
shed we use that thing for the garden
and lots of people still garden with
very simple improvement tools
lots of people might mind their own
personal asteroid with simple tools too
for all i know as a recreational hobby
it's could exercise but
more importantly driving your tractor
around instead of playing with a horse
or
a hoe does not mean that you are not a
farmer
for that same reason running a whole
horde of drone mining
devices that you yourself have never
even come within a hundred miles of the
actual asteroid that's doing it
does not mean that you are not a miner
if that's how you make your money what
do you say to people at the point
i'm a robot mining supervisor no you say
all right mine ore
so that that will just change like many
things that will change will people
actually be swinging around
um you know picks and axes on other
planets probably not will they
themselves be getting out of the ship in
a spacesuit to tether something down
occasionally but probably the sense of
it's gonna be faster and easier when we
go out there and see what the
what the hassle is and fix it with eyes
on but that just depends on how
comfortable people get with like
virtually controlled robots i'd rather
my eyes on
be like the robot that anakin makes that
fixes his shift while it's flying
what no he didn't make c-3po
he made the uh yes the other person but
wait oh my god he
didn't make r2d2 he made c-3po oh
youtube was when he fixed the
we're not going to get into the star
wars prequel trilogy
i like that kind of robot any rate
moving on we have a question from martin
stallard and thank you also for your
donation martin
could a planet have an atmosphere with
noble gases
absolutely all right next question
yes uh most the planets of solar system
do have
atmospheres of double gases your noble
gases are helium
the second most common gas in the
universe then what is actually this
fluorine or neon one or two i think it's
neon
uh and then it goes to um the argon and
there's all gone on all plastic the most
common gas or second most common gas
there's a lot of those out there and so
it's one thing you tend to find out a
lot
we have a question from sono bello if we
could make wormholes could we also tweak
space in order to make rooms that are
bigger on the inside
like the inside of the tardis from
doctor who
i never thought it was big on the
outside i always thought it was smaller
smaller on the outside and bigger on the
inside it said bigger on the inside
it's small on the outside
you've seen that you've seen doctor who
i think that's what the question is
this is always an example of this big
box and we also call this hammer space
uh which is for those who've seen your
looney tunes things where the the coyote
or
whoever pulls a a hammer out of nowhere
to hit people with or an anvil out of
nowhere
hammer space being the idea of where
they keep that farm away a large pocket
dimension
your bag of hoarding for those of you
are dungeons and dragons fans
um and um if you can make a wormhole you
have the alternate of that which is
instead of having
a bag that is bigger on the outside you
instead have a bag that's got a hole in
it that reaches into a warehouse you've
got somewhere else
and we did look at that more in our
episode wormholes
back in about like 2016 it's been a lot
we should probably do the one horse
episode sometime
got a question here from henry myers
thank you also henry for your
donation isaac what do you think about
converting jupiter trojans into freight
travel for asteroid mining
um the trojan asteroids and i guess the
greek asteroids too are at it
um because there's there's technically
two different belts you know we always
for the both is the trojans
um they are potentially very handy for
that because you could very easily start
putting them into some interesting
orbits that might make the very good
uh interplanetary cyclos but um
whenever you're trying to take a rock
and turn into a spacecraft and that's a
critical thing we talk about like let's
carve out an asteroid and use a
spaceship to another solar system
the hard part of spaceships is not
coming up with all the metal to make
them
thick hold and shielded the hard part is
coming with all the fuel to push them
so spacecrafts are tiny skinny fragile
things because fuel
uh using a gigantic asteroid doesn't
really help with that situation as a
result
because like a couple meters of random
rock is really not as good as say
10 centimeters of depleted uranium steel
armor
just a couple more questions before the
break we have a question from james
james sharp hi great channel what are
your thoughts on colonizing the moon
versus colonizing mars
this one comes up a lot and i i i
understand why people want to do
marvel's first in many ways it's a
better colonization spot but
the moon is much more useful to us mars
is i should put this
mars is a gigantic red rock that has a
big gravity well and is a useless
hunk of garbage well that's putting it
bluntly
is a place you could live but so is
antarctica uh
i would you would you would be better
off to colonize antarctica than to call
nice marbles
do i think we should call an eye as well
as one day absolutely we've done some
episodes on that um
which one is our priority for actually
getting up in space and and getting
stuff done in space and
expanding humanity out into space the
moon why
the moon is nearby it's kind of
gravitationally on your way out of the
earth system
and uh it's got a lot of stuff on it but
it doesn't have as much stuff as walls
which is advantageous because
gravity uh the more stuff you got the
more gravity you got and
we want a lot of stuff but we want to
have to not drag it out of a gigantic
gravity well
so the moon is really good for that last
question before the break is from kd
sir isaac do you have possible thoughts
on the upcoming release of the
foundation series on apple tv
you know i uh my biggest thought with
the foundation series coming up on apple
tv
uh i love the trailer uh visually it was
great and then my second thought on that
was
please don't screw it up yeah every time
they give a take a classic science
fiction or fantasy series and turn it
into a
tv show movie my first thought is please
don't screw it up uh then my second
thought is let's have lower expectations
because you want to be able to enjoy a
thing don't don't put up on too much of
a pedestal
otherwise you'll never enjoy the show
and some shows have been quite good
um many episodes game of thrones were
very good compared to the the book
series
many were not um i mean the books in
that series aren't increasingly good
either
um and you know the foundation series
the trilogy is great the some of the
sequels asked my vote later on like
foundation's edge and foundation earth
were really not that great either though
so
um but uh they weren't bad either
they're worth waiting
one of the greatest science fiction
series if not the greatest science
fiction series
in history uh by my namesake and the
grand master of science fiction is
asthma
uh there's no one's gonna match that tv
show wise to manage to pull that off but
they can probably do a pretty good job
and if they
put the right effort into it if they
tried it right they didn't expand a few
others
then we might have a really good tv show
and that's what i'm hoping for and i
will go into it
hoping that's what it is and not putting
my expectations too high
so all right we're gonna go ahead and go
to break and we'll see in about four
minutes
so we will be on break for a few minutes
so we can all grab a drink and a snack
and you can get some more questions into
the chat while we're on break i thought
we spent a couple minutes talking about
roko's basilisk a bit more
or rather its resemblance to pascal's
wager and its variation
pasco's basilisk and how they fit with
things like free will or asking at the
universe is really a dream
we discussed roko's basilisk in passing
in our episode on resurrection a couple
weeks back
and solution and machine intelligence of
vast capability can hypothetically
calculate the trajectories of particles
in the present
to extrapolate where they were in the
past or in short
to see where the various atoms composing
your neurons were before you died
which can then reproduce or simulate to
effectively resurrect someone
now we principally raised roko's
basilisk to point out how it was
impossible
but roku's basis comes up as a type of
malicious resurrection
essentially you could resurrect someone
to torture them and that
in this way a computer mind which does
not yet exist can cross people alive
now to help it come into existence by
worrying that it will eventually come to
exist no matter what we do
and that those who did not aid this will
be resurrected and punished
the argument has a ton wrong with it and
often gets compared to famous
mathematician blaise pascal's well-known
wager which is that since god
either does or does not exist and that
people who follow his commands either go
to heaven or are punished for disbelief
then you should always opt to believe in
god since the downside of that is that
if god doesn't exist
you are not getting the aft life good or
ill whereas the disbeliever
has it as their best outcome the other
being eternal torment
a common objection to both pascal's
wager and roku's basilisk
is that treating these options as binary
that either an ai exists who will
torture people retroactively for not
working to bring it about
or does not exist when there are a whole
ton of other options
and same for pascal's wager a common
objection is many gods
which is to say your options are not
binary and other possible deities with
other rules might exist
following thor or zeus might get you in
trouble if you die and it's anubis who
greet you
now there's character arguments to both
of those too but we're not interested in
those at the moment
rather it's this 2x2 grid of x is either
true or false
and you can't know which and why it's
something you get to choose
in this case you have no control over
whether the ai or god exists
and i'll assume to have no way to prove
either case either way
but you do get to pick which option you
choose to believe will occur or is true
and again both pascal and roko's options
are pushed as binary
when they really probably should not be
we do have a fair few number of other
problems that are more binary of this
type though
or at least ones where i've not heard of
a third option of consequence
for instance we have dream or simulation
questions
stuff is either real or it is not and to
the best of my knowledge we have no way
to determine that
thus we would say there are four options
things are either real or they are not
and i either act like they are real or i
do not
and thus i choose to assume things are
real because if i assume they are
and they are not then i'm out very
little whereas if i assume it's unreal
and it is real
i'm potentially squandering my existence
for no better return
than constant existential crises and the
same applies to free will
we can't prove we have it or do not but
i can't think of a third option besides
those two
of significance so i can only pick if i
believe i have free will or not
and assuming i have free will when i do
not seems a better option for being
wrong
than assuming i do not have free will if
it turns out i do
and you can do the same for a lot of
other things but carefully
as an example you could do it for if
life has a meaning or not
and if you believe it does but hit the
same issue with vocals basilisk or
pascal's wager
if you're altering that to a specific
meaning of life and consequence of
belief or
disbelief or for that matter if you're
dealing with the reality case and the
condition for emerging from a fake
reality to the real one
is becoming aware it's a fake and that's
an essential concept as when dealing
with the future or with philosophical
problems
we often tend to get trapped into
thinking we have a dichotomy with only
two options
and sometimes that might be so but at
the same time we often get a bit stuck
in what turns out to be a false
dichotomy
and we encounter this a lot in the
topics we look at on this show and it's
a fairly common question
with all that said let's get back to the
show and more of your questions
and we're back
well we had an interesting question and
i wanted to wait until after the break
so that everyone could have the
opportunity to hear
your drink and a snack reference and
this was from coco butt would you
license
drink in a snack as a restaurant chain
and would you let the kardashev
scale be used for the super size menu
first i think we were saying earlier
about people with strange usernames
sorry okay that is a good one the k25s
what kind of files you have the k2
although i guess the k25s would be what
a quadrillion french fries then um
i don't know even by the consumption
standards of folks eating fast food and
more of it than they should
the carter show scale might be too big
for that
uh i love that idea they're drinking a
snack
so yes that's a good one
we have a question from bin sai and
games
do you think pocket dimensions could be
an answer to the fermi paradox
and that is where they could all be
hiding it's one of the better ones um
you know we're looking at the dyson
dilemma which is kind of where we we
base almost everything offer for where
we say the fully paradox
most likely resolves is than just being
incredibly rare
one of the assumptions we have there is
that you're going to want to keep
growing as a civilization
right and not even necessarily as a
cohesive civilization just that you're
not likely to ever be flatline your
civilization you're probably always
going to be growing while you can
another is that you really don't have
any better source of places to grow
other than the universal manager and
that's critically the other big one
you need resource energy to grow off of
and if the universe around you is the
best place to get that then you do right
well it's very hard to get resources off
of the moon let alone
your alpha centauri so if you've got a
better source
uh eg wormhole that just goes to another
plant that's very likely than a
multiverse
or if you can open up pocket dimensions
to your own personal big bangs then
yes that would be where you tend to grow
now the caveat on that
as a phony paradox solution is that
while you would presume you want to
colonize
you know parallel realities with
staccato of earth or pocket dimensions
in which you had virtually infinite
resources at your fingertips
if you have those kind of resources if
you have that ease of access
then it's really easy for you to build
gigantic spaceships probes telescopes
etc
uh and decide you know let's go ahead
and dump a few
trillion terawatts of of broadcasting
power into see there's amios in this
galaxy because to you it's nothing
right it's it's like saying i'm going to
throw a piece of paper on the wind and
see if
he heals it um it just costs nothing so
um that is the big caveat on almost any
electronic resource restrictions of of
one economize universe 4 resources
we have a question from levi hinkle as
well as a donation thank you levi
what complications do you see when
humanity tries to learn its first
alien language even if it's if it's at
even spoken and not like
smell touch taste or gestures
um i'm trying to move we actually
released the i know we did a
alien niger's episode recently i just
can't remember it was one of the ones
that just came out or if it's one that's
coming out soon because i just wrote it
uh
we have an alien languages episode
that's either recently come out or it's
coming up soon
it's probably one of the ones playing up
on the screen and i think about it um
anyway um
big thing with alien languages they are
realistically only three ways
four ways we get alien languages one we
start hearing a signal from them
uh in their language two we start
hearing a signal from them in our
language
three they land on earth or four we land
on their homeworld
right um it
really is no scenario for us just
happening to bump into somebody who is
around the same
level as us right uh so we'll probably
have plenty of time to look
and analyze it or vice versa
they are going to have have plenty of
time to look at and analyze ours
but any language that is not going to be
of human origin is going to be
mind-boggling how to translate your
chance of actually going to speak it
using your throat and voice is going to
be
very minimal there's a simpsons
halloween episode
where they introduce codes and kang for
the first time i think um
where they ask is uh well what's your
name says kodo so
kang and it says well that's not my
actual name but if you were to try to
pronounce my name
i'd have to rip out your tongue so you
could do it you know
that's probably optimistic about the
kind of modification you need to speak
any alien language
a question from mark zimmerman what
situations
would human space marines be used in the
event of an orbital conflict
uh there's the question of why would we
be using human infantry
or or humans and fighter jets for
instance of
space fighters in the future these are
popular staples of science fiction
because you want to be at the moment of
tension of the action
and that means putting a human at the
console or putting a human
at the rifle i would say well that's
good for attention science fiction
and so in science fiction you always see
space marines whether they are they are
superhuman or not in the future conflict
as opposed to some robot that is not
even
humanoid um when would you ever actually
have humans though in these conflicts
and this is the thing is for a given
value of human whatever the sentient
critters are
alien human trans human robot
intelligences
that is the center of your civilization
actually runs things that your military
is there to protect
that is who the enemy wishes to attack
to the enemy does not want to blow up
your drones
right if they want to into war with you
or start a war with you or whatever it
is
they're going after you right so
that is the kind of situation where
personal body armor or you know things a
lot of those lines start making a
difference
there's those conflict zones where
people are at that's where that's going
to be happening
but you do all your fighting with
possible with you know things which are
not conforming to a human physiology
verizon says hi isaac building an
orbital ring for space
travel right now is not economically
viable but would pushing to build one
for the travel and green energy benefits
be politically viable in the near future
depends what you mean by near future um
we have to put we have a lot of
prototype to do in theory you can put a
wire
that's no no wider than the one running
off my microphone right now
um to be an orbital ring around the
planet
uh so it might cost you you know uh a
million dollars to manufacture that wire
and
uh you know 100 million to jump up into
space
um however just having that wire out
there doesn't really do
much good the the idea is to have one
that's strong enough tough enough you
can write a tether down to it or
something like xylon
uh which makes it a very bridged and
easier to make space elevator
or something big enough that you can
claw your way up to the top of it or
land up like something like a
hypersonic plane and uh then have space
infrastructure on top of it that's what
makes them very big
and hard to do um but uh
when is the willpower there for that not
until you really
i mean in my opinion i would say if you
don't get at least a couple hundred
people
coming to or leaving space every day on
average you're not to that zone yet
right that's that that's where you start
thinking about these big old launch
systems that that require
you know hundreds of billions of dollars
worth of infrastructure just to get
running
so uh we have a question from a serba as
well as a donation thank you
serba how much of a strategic advantage
would
holding the moon provide and would it be
enough of an advantage to spur
a country's rivals to view a lunar
garrison
as an existential threat
i think that in the modern context
um having a lunar gears in that the an
opposition
saw as military advantageous would be
disadvantageous because you don't
actually want other people to
view you as a threat when they have a
very easy way to strike back at you you
see
we can have a nice big old moon base
where you can have all the weapons in
the world we want on that moon base and
you put some awesome weapons on moonbase
space is a great place to put weapons at
um
the problem is that all of our citizens
live here on earth
so i've got an awesome moon base with
infinite destructive power
but i also have all my people down here
on earth and they're so easy to shoot or
blow up
by other people living here on earth so
you
you probably are going to see people
wanting to take advantage of the
strategic
options there you know the mining
potential the space potential the
weapons potential
but i don't think you'd actually have
people trying to go out of the way to
have a
military base on the moon in the near
future
that is further down the line because
that's provocative and
you don't mind provocative if it doesn't
you know doesn't avail anybody but if
provocative
makes people point guns to you and you
don't have any body armor
not a good idea so that's probably where
that would stand
merv johnson thank you for your ten
dollar donation
as well and merv wants to know if you
could do an episode on faster than light
and causality he says us on the
subreddit struggle with this
often when discussing any ftl topic
we actually did do some ftl episodes way
back in the day was ftr series
the problem is i almost never actually
recommend them i mean that warm whole
episode was the last one
that i mentioned earlier um because they
are the first
actual attempt of a series really on the
show um if you
for those of you date back like 2000
well i 15 and 16
uh i was very fast in my coverage of
those topics because i've been told if
you try to do
episodes that want about 10 to 15
minutes long
you're never gonna have a youtube
channel that succeeds uh i eventually
gave up on that by the time i was trying
to compress more material
by speeding up the you speak the scripts
so
not all episodes i usually recommend
people can't understand them too well
but if you're used to my voice try out
the ftl series i've been meaning to
remake it for a while but the problem is
you know as you say with the future
people say hey are you ever worried
about running out of topics
no no there's always so much more in the
future to do i don't really like to redo
episodes we've already done too often
unless it's really called for
and i know i should redo the ftl series
at some point but
there's so many other episodes i still
want to do too so we'll probably put
that on there and discuss the
antioxidant in that but we did do a time
travel episode
um early last year too which i'd
recommend too
time travel i think that was just the
name of the episode from january of 2020
so try that one out and see if it helps
okay we have a question from daniel
bondt
hello isaac would the air and water in
an o'neill cylinder
lag a bit behind the solids if they
would that might produce a breeze
and what are the possible landscaping
choices that it would produce
you shouldn't that i've taught my head
you wouldn't um
but i might have to think on that a
little bit because you could get some
very minimal effects
um you do have weather inside one of
those and it's because the gravity's way
different there's a spin going on
i mean what causes the weather on earth
spin when it's mostly spin but there's
also
spin with the sun that's in one
direction or two
uh so it's not just because the planet's
spinning it's because the planet's
spinning under a gigantic heater
um but uh there really shouldn't be any
lag that i can think about top my head
you could have some kind of tidal
effects i'm not thinking of just because
there's slightly lower gravity on the
you know higher levels
and that could cause something but uh i
have to really think on that one so that
that would be an example one of those
things though that i wouldn't want to
speak of conclusively until after we
actually built a few of them
and saw the real world effects because
what's on paper
and what actually happens when you do
the you know dirty evil engineering
and trans donate always always a little
bit different
well we have a comment here from michael
clack he says isaac you and sarah are
awesome my
question is if an ai wanted to kill all
humans how could it secure its power and
processing ability
um um well i think that's probably a
chicken egg situation now
if it wants to kill all the humans it
obviously first has to have those
secured force so it can't blow us up and
then establish independence
um you shoot the guy who feeds you as a
war um
not the best plan so first obviously the
ai needs to establish those
um and that's going to depend so much on
how it's doing it if i
were an evil ai which contrary to
internet rumor i am not
again we do live streams partially to my
people i'm not a computer program
and uh if i wore one though
what i'd start off by doing is getting a
little bit of control on the market get
some funds through donations
you know whatever it was hey send me
this you know send me money for x i
might provide them a product there are
always things that you know people want
in terms of data get those donations in
bitcoin whatever it is start buying real
water assets with them
and then just have those bits and pieces
shipped by regular old companies to me
and from there i'll start creating those
self-replicating machines robots or
automated factories
and make money off of those and that's
where you get your start you get a huge
amount of
you know multitask stockpile of funds
resources and production
and then the robot might save itself you
know it's so much easier to work inside
the system as is because i've had to
develop all these
psychology and marketing algorithms
anyway to be most effective
maybe i don't need to kill the humans
off at this point you know but
if it was that's still about i go is
take advantage of the stuff that's
already in place
so we have a question from sci-fi by
alan crawley
thank you also for your generous
donation he says i didn't see
construction of communities factories or
facilities
at l5 in the nss space road map
what infrastructure needs to be in place
before humanity is in a position to
construct things
at l5 and l4
i guess the big thing is well we could
build stuff there right now we put stuff
up there
um in terms of like small satellites and
i i guess that would depend on whether
you meant the lunar l5s or the earth's
actual
5's of the sun uh l4145 um
the trojan points um
building up there infrastructure wise is
mostly about not just
having the actual capacity to build up
there as is having something you need to
build
up there and the thing to forget is that
um right now the main value of orbital
space for us is that
if there's no gravity there it's like we
would say we need a routine section a
rotating section for gravity on the
space station
say well yes it would help but really
what's nice about the space station is
the one place we can actually experiment
on that doesn't have gravity it's not
really that much of us to put there
um the l5 point the l4 point they're
very valuable from kind of launch and
infrastructural standpoint there'll be
you know
big hubs down the road and for space
development but
they're not really all that advantageous
themselves for purpose of these sort of
manufacturing so
they're mostly about having them as
places we we think about putting on your
cylinder but you don't need no no
certainly
thousands of people living in space and
that's pretty much the key there it's
not
though it's hard to build up there so
much it's hard to get the infrastructure
up there and the resources and
real the other reason to do it eric
johansson thank you for your donation
and eric's as could we build a tether
situated in leo
that perhaps the solar power could
maintain its orbit by pushing off of the
earth's magnetic field
so i was i i got the chat up on the side
window for me too that i mostly don't
notice but i just caught that one from
wolf johnson as
isaac says if he was an evil ai he'd
take donations
on a live stream where we donate to him
so yes good point
i was thinking the same thing and i was
like wow
what are you not telling me
did you forget the current question it
was about
electro dynamic tethering with it or
what's that um
oh yeah eric johansson could we build a
tether situated in leo of with solar
power that can maintain its over by
pushing out the earth's magnetic field
yes that is electrodynamic tethering
there is a company that's been looking
at that i've been working in a while in
terms of looking up on it was
called tethos unlimited um
and we looked at that in the episode
skyhooks
way way back skyhooks episode 2 which
itself is also very old
um where we explain what that is but
essentially
big magnetic field on the planet not
really good for powering things but is
very good for pushing on things if you
have power
so you build a really long tether like
hundreds of kilometers long
and you run an electromagnetic field on
that and that you push off of the planet
itself
or any other plant that has a big
magnetic field which
unfortunately is not all of them um very
handy if like jupiter for instance
uh and you just need a source of
electricity at that point and that is
where you get the solar panels in there
why this is handy for sky hooks is
because cy hooks can very slowly
regenerate their momentum
um but uh doing that this is not good as
a proportion system by itself but it's
very good for slowly pushing large
objects up
um and um
i keep forgetting what the actual
question was i think that was the actual
question yes
yes you can push off the earth's
magnetic field to keep spacecraft in
orbit or do station keeping
it must be getting close to the end uh
time for a few more questions
oh yes we have time for a few more we
have a question from isaac bradeau
do you think we will tap into the
quantum fluctuations in the vacuum
excuse me
uh assuming that's questions can we do
vacuum point energy oh
that wasn't the end of the question i'm
sorry the uh
pressure is changing isaac brudeau says
do you think we will tap into the
quantum fluctuations in the vacuum of
space
as an energy source yeah just notice the
weather is actually changing outside of
the pressure
the sunny sky the sunny the sun is gone
yeah that's
right the pressure is really coming down
so can we do vacuum energy
um that would be awesome if we could but
the problem with vacuum energy is kind
of like the baseline energy of the
universe
um there's a lot of it but trying to tap
into like trying to tap a lukewarm
bathtub
for power you you need some you need you
need some place that's down
in order to get power as well your
quarter or low or whatever it is
there's really no place beneath the
vacuum uh and that's exactly what we
start talking about well how can we
generate energy off that vacuum is
can we go one level lower than that
energy level and
we start talking about that we start
saying well if we did that will we
accidentally puncture
the universe and drain the whole thing
out metaphysically
and the answer that is possibly we don't
know that's out of all listed options
for ways you might accidentally destroy
the universe
but i tend to be the opinion that you
cannot tap vacuum energy usefully
for energy but i would love to be proven
wrong but only proven wrong in a
non-destructive way that does not blow
up the universe
okay well here's a here's an interesting
question from super jay kramer
do you normally wear a suit in your own
house i don't know where you're in today
i guess i usually do my own for live
streams
um no i don't normally wear a suit in my
house i usually sit at my desk here in
uh
what t-shirt and and sweat bands it's
like my work uniform i i my pajamas
i i just walked around the house all day
my pajamas
um as i used to recommend before
you wear a suit a lot more than most
people i know for
being around home yeah i know i probably
one of the few people actually wears a
suit for walk inside the home and takes
off to go outside um yeah
um we have a another strange name here
hand sanitizer
and he says isaac please do a talk on
clubhouse man i'll invite you if you
aren't on it
okay clubhouse is that app that's the
best my knowledge is only on
itunes and i mostly hear about it as
really awesome from
some of our sister channels with
standard um like devin from legal eagle
uh if you've not seen legal eagle go
watch that that's funny um
everyone know he likes that too but i i
know i'm not i'm not an apple person i
have
no apple no iphone you have an ipad
don't you
no no okay all right so i'm not i'm not
a big apple person
i think clubhouse last i checked was
still an apple only thing
so discord is probably the closest thing
i do to using that
question from jerry tork what happens
when a neutron star
finally loses its angular momentum and
no longer has
input in material does it decay somehow
eventually
uh neutron stars slowly lose them energy
from magnetic fields
you're pushing out that energy that's
making them pulse oil in the first place
but once they go to a certain point
they're just going to start spinning
around normally like any other object
given time every object that spins
around will lose that
to well quantum flacking uh vacuum
fluctuations
as virtual particles come out to slow
and act them as a fiction but that takes
continuous views so not really i think
i've got three questions left here at
the moment that we can fit in uh
the first one is from aisle steinman
what would
an eventual solution to the theory of
everything bring to science and humanity
you know i was actually just talking uh
to one of the folks
brian keating i might be thinking his
name right now
um he did the uh oh my
god i can't move his name off i know the
name of the book
he's one of the folks working on on uh
thinking of everything though is a
book recently on that topic which i
think is like our book of the month next
month actually
um i tend to be a bit iffy on theories
of everything in general because
i tend to feel like it's it's trying to
find an answer
it's taking an assumption that there is
a unification right
of these concepts of these things
because we've had some other forces
trying to be unified
to electricity and magnetism or the
those with the weak nuclear force and
strong nuclear force
i don't assume that gravity has to have
the same unification somewhere online
with electromagnetism that would be
awesome if it does
but i don't like to start with that as
an assumption that that answer is
definitely true and i think that
one thing i tend to have a bit of a
debate with folks on is
that we often just work on the
assumption that there is a unified
theory of everything
i don't know that we should be just
making the assumption even i think the
philosopher's true
rational asks a recent development of a
mechanical artificial womb for mice
is promising how would having viable
artificial wounds for humans
affect humanity in the near and far
future
very awesomely um first it changes the
state on when people can actually have
children themselves
right uh let's say you get to be 60
years old and you you put your creole
behind you you
focus on your career to get uh out there
and and get big with your career and you
didn't have a family now you want a
family you're 60 years old
um that's exactly where something like a
mechanical room starts letting people do
that
um or they still want to have more
children they have as big a family as
they want
um other options is it allows us to
potentially take a child who's
maybe in a distressed pregnancy you know
say a month or two and we detect some
issues with the child's
pregnancy and now we can go ahead and
pull them out and keep them in a
mechanical artificial room
as a hospital where they can be it's you
know more directly tended to
um so it just gives us a lot more
options
for health intervention or portly in
general
okay last question of the day is going
to jackson
matterhorn hey isaac is your online
content copyrighted can i use some of
your ideas as inspiration for a short
story
that's all copyright yeah no all content
is copyrighted um
but can you use it in terms of the
concepts or ideas
first a lot of it's not mine in origin
right some of the concepts like light
guides or watched planets those yes
those are right but mostly it's other
people's ideas that i've borrowed myself
regardless of whether it's one of mine
or not though yes for the purpose of
fiction
for the force of doing another episode
on a rival channel either the concepts
themselves
go right ahead and the names of them
those are free to use too it avoids
confusion down the road
also feel free to change the names of
the concepts because i'm really bad at
queening names too so
but yes you are welcome to using these
ideas the show which he started as as
advice for science fiction shows or some
degree anyway so
you write a book something like that and
you think a bush plant is an awesome
idea or like it's an awesome idea
or you you know you want to use all
concepts in the fully paradox in the
episodes
go ahead with my blessing and uh i would
say for everybody else
if you are still able to enjoy any good
weather and you don't have a storm
sweeping
in go out and enjoy that day with my
blessing too so
we will see you on thursday thank you
for your time
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook
reddit discord or our website
isaacarthur.net
thanks
