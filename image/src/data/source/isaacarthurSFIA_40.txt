While we normally think of rotating space
habitats as rings or cylinders, there’s
no actual need for a complete circular structure
to produce spin gravity, merely that it spins
in a complete circle.
Spin Gravity is also often thought to be best
if produced with a rate at least 2 rpm, which
for normal gravity means a ring or cylinder
diameter of 447 meters or 1467 feet, or a
circumference of 1.4 kilometers or nearly
a mile.
That’s a lot of space, needing a lot of
material to build it and shield it from radiation,
especially for a crew of a dozen.
You could have large habitation pods on tethers
or pressurized inflatable tubes that just
extend out from the main body of the ship
when you’re in cruise mode between worlds,
and that might be more the size of an apartment.
This resembles a bolo or twirling hammer,
or a pair of them, and indeed you can add
as many as you like, including a side airlock
if you want to connect pods, even to form
a ring or cylinder of them.
