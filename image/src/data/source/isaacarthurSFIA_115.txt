We don’t know when we might bump 
into another intelligent alien  
civilization or what the practical 
limit on spaceship travel might be,  
but we do have spaceship designs that could 
travel at 99% of light speed. So the roughly one  
trillion stars in our galaxy and its immediate 
neighbors like Andromeda is not the limit. 
Rather, with Hubble expansion moving all those 
other galaxies away, at roughly 7% of light speed  
per billion light years of current distance, 
nothing much over 14 billion light years away  
could ever be reached even by radio signal, 
just 9% of the Observable Universe’s volume,  
for a total of 18 billion-trillion stars through 
10-20 billion galaxies. But anything much beyond  
10 billion light years get’s dubious, as getting 
there would take a ship over 30 billion years,  
and something 13 billion light years away, 
traveled to at at 99% of light speed,  
would take about 160 billion years for a ship 
to reach while swimming uphill against Hubble  
Expansion. Any further and even if you reached 
it, all the stars might all have died off by then.
