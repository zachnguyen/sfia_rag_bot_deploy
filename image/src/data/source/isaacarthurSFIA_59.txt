Simple Biological Cells are able to perform
a handful of tasks while gathering resources
to reproduce themselves, and so we believe
it should be possible to build tiny machines
that can act in this way too, but which might
be able to perform more complex tasks, replicate
more quickly, be smaller, or be more robust.
These self-replicating nanobots may all be
of the same type or we might employ many different
varieties and sizes, much as we often see
in nature.
These nanobots could get out of control and
potentially consume all matter on Earth, leaving
behind only vast swaths of "grey goo" â€“ the
byproduct of their uncontrolled replication.
In practice, these huge seas of grey goo would
diverge into ecosystems of there own much
as organic life, or simple green goo, once
did.
By forming the crust of the planet, with a
top layer of sun-absorbing nanobots and a
bottom layer dwelling as close to the high-temperature
and high-pressure magma layers as they could,
potentially setting off a new ecosystem with
nanobot diversification and predator-prey
cycles.
