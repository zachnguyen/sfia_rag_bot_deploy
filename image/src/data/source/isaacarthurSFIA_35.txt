A Chandelier city is a massive collection of 
upside down buildings hanging from an orbital  
ring around a large planet, such as a gas giant, 
and was first discussed in our episode Colonizing  
Neptune. Since many planets have no fixed surface 
we could possibly build on, we would place an  
orbital ring, planetary bracelet, or stripworld in 
the upper atmosphere held rigid by active support. 
At this point we can build up like 
normal, via compressive strength,  
but into higher and thinner air, or hang down 
by tensile strength into a thicker atmosphere,  
which might even be breathable or at least 
at normal earth pressure ranges. Many of  
these hanging around the ring might look like 
icicle Christmas lights, but urban clusters  
would look more a chandelier, and both may be very 
popular approaches to habitats on on gas giants,  
ice giants, thick-atmosphere Super-Earths and 
any other world where living on the surface was  
not viable. Though the technology works on any 
world, including Earth or airless planetoids.
