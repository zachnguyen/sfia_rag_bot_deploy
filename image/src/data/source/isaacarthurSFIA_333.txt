good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q
a we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink
and a snack though we'll take a break
about halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
good afternoon everyone and welcome to
our monthly live stream q a we'll go
again start with your questions in just
a moment
but uh first i want to go ahead and say
welcome to what will probably be our one
year anniversary of using the studio
and our last occasion probably using the
studio we might do the one for maine
here
but sarah and i are signing for a house
tomorrow and today is our first
anniversary since we got married last
year so
that's want to say congratulations to my
wife
and uh it's been a very good year thus
far for me needless to say it's a great
way to be ending it up but
we'll be switching the studio in may and
then just depending on how well
setup goes probably that would be where
we mean live stream from
uh and i would say if you see me in this
live stream at this location again it
probably means i'm irritating behind
schedule so
so what are your questions whatever you
are well maybe we should start with the
question that said what's mrs arthur's
first
name what is your first name anyway now
that's a trick question
wait is that it's your first anniversary
and you should not forget that
this is isaac awful isn't it so that's a
congratulation mr mrs isaac also
my wife's name is the arnold sarah
elaine fowler although district 99
that had a little bit of addendum added
into it
well remember when we were getting
married a year ago and
people were commenting on how your show
name and our names fit perfectly
together
so they can remember it very easily by
looking at the sfia logo at sarah fowler
and isaac arthur
that's of course why i just wanted to
mail you it comes sfia
oh my well we had a couple questions
here from
uh the show last month that we were
unable to
get to we have a question from albert
jackson hey
isaac thanks for hosting today i've been
thinking about education recently and
i've been wondering
would being able to download knowledge
directly to the brain maybe being able
to learn it automatically
change formal education and if so how
it's a great way long kung fu
uh for those who remember the movie the
matrix back in i was in 1999 that came
out
so that's well um one of the big things
there was that you could download
knowledge skills directly into someone's
head
um that actually wouldn't work for
someone
in a biological sense like they might
know it for inside the matrix somehow
but
you actually have a lot of muscle memory
associated things like that skills like
that
and so i think we can't just assume you
could download something directly into a
human's brain uh though
obviously you could probably really
improve education if you learn how to do
that right
you just instantly know stuff but that's
the thing to keep in mind for artificial
intelligence too we talk about body of
neural networks
i don't know why it assumes that
computer intelligence would just
instantly know something if you download
in their head
any more than we do when you download in
front of our eyes um
don't assume that an ai can
instantaneously learn a subject by
tuning into wikipedia for it but
obviously if we can find ways to
download information more directly into
people's heads
skills things like that big difference
you know
so thought criminal says isaac are you
familiar with robert
robin hansen and the age of m
yeah yes em
a little bit a little bit yeah okay he
says the basic idea is that if
whole brain emulation becomes possible
the emulations or m's will eventually
outnumber biological humans
do you have any comments on that
probably one of those questions come the
simulation hypothesis that big question
whether or not we live in a simulation
is if those
simulated or emulated minds already
outnumber the rest of us or real people
or if you're one of them
um if it's easier to store run and
maintain people
on a digital system and i say to do this
for people being
that this process is actually possible
and would create actual real humans
you know it looks like a duck quacks
like a duck etc if people feel that
that's just as good
then yes i think you probably would see
more of that but that's one of those
wait until it happens but they make
really good statements about it
the zyric says
much of the known reality has been
observed to move away from us
faster than the light than the speed of
light
doesn't that also imply that much can
also be moving toward us
faster than the speed of light and could
we ever know if it was
before it was too late no yeah that is
the one downside about uh when you're
moving away from someone faster speed of
light
um you're you know you you stop you know
you get light from them until they're
too far away
they start becoming invisible to you
because you keep going for them for the
way faster than the
light can cover it fascinates the other
way around is that the thing hits you
before the light gets there yeah this
comes up a lot of times with uh
spacebars or anything fast and light is
how exactly is that they're firing all
these weapons or pros or torpedoes out
at warp speed from the ship
uh which itself is moving at warp speed
and these things are soon to be going at
light speed uh
a scene from the force awakens which is
one of the newer star wars movies i'm
kind of okay with i'm not too happy with
some of these star wars movies uh
canon wise because i'm a big legends fan
uh they
show the the blowing up of the capital
of the
republic i i don't remember its name
because it's it's not coruscant um
and everybody can see it including the
rebels on a different planet as the as
the strike comes in
as they were they in the same solar
system that they were able to see this
attack
uh no that's an interesting coincidence
so in a galaxy that big
but uh yeah with fast light objects
moving towards us or if they're things
moving towards us no we were not the
effects of them from things like gravity
would not have
reached us yet they did take that into
consideration in the last star wars
video that we watched though because
remember the
captain of the ship had to say hold on
hold on hold on i'm calibrating this so
that we don't hit any big
actions on the way through oh and that's
that classic one is
we just got around to watching the
original star wars been going through
them in order like
the first three movies and clone wars
films and now we just got to star wars
the new hope um and there's that classic
scene there
where um han solo talks about being able
to do the kessel run in in 12 parsecs
and of course a distance not a time so i
remember all the various little ways
they kind of can and fix that so it's
like oh it's a very tight tone he was
able to do it that that
short of a distance but a good movie
it's still better than some of the other
star wars
[Laughter]
okay oh instantly for those of you we
were going through a couple questions
from the previous month we were getting
things keyed up in the chat uh we'll be
moving those now
plenty of times to get questions to chat
we usually take a break about halfway
through
so we got about an hour to go mr arthur
the sun is heating up
am i to believe this will increase the
circumference of our sun's habitable
zone
if so what could humanity do to increase
earth's orbit around the sun
therefore always staying in the center
of the ever-growing goldilocks zone
thank you and have a sunny day thank you
too uh never more 71 in the future
the sun heats up but it is a slow
process i i
don't know if we pin down the exact
amount but i think it's like one percent
for 100 million years
um that doesn't really change our
circumstance i mean for the habitable
zone that is going to increase it
right but it's a slow process as to
moving the planet it wouldn't take that
much
um the planet is really heavy and has a
lot of angular momentum
indeed is actually fairly parallel to
what you need to disassemble the planet
um
to death start if you would which is a
huge amount of energy
um and it's actually more energy in the
sun releases the entire week but there
you go it's kind of the idea of the zone
let's say we put a reflective plate the
size of
texas you know we just covered over the
reflective foil and aim some extra
sunlight at that
maybe even put some walls around that so
that uh you will
have that heat stay in the atmosphere
you could put use some big beam from the
sun for some
sort of mirror and use that to just push
on the plant to push a little bit away
i know we talked about this in an
episode that's really how you move a
planet
um probably probably planet ships it
would probably be the episode planet
chips
or evacuation earth i think we talked
about that specific case there too so
but we'll go into a lot more detail
about there
um bobo master says what would happen if
an exoplanet had an
iron-rich atmosphere i would assume it
would give the sky a reddish hue
but how would it impact the possibility
for life
an iron rich atmosphere would be a
tricky thing to maintain in the long
term i mean that's that was one of the
problems with theoretically having
oxygen on an early earth is
uh uh you know as a waste product of
life that time was
it would be getting sucked up by all the
iron uh so the oxygen wasn't staying
there
an iron rich atmosphere would probably
have a
big problem existing very long you'd
almost have to have some kind of
geological process that was spitting
iron into the air pretty regularly
and the question is it like which type
of io is just regular ion or is it you
know
iron oxide which you can expect they're
breathing
um what was the actual question again
that was pretty much the question what
would happen if an exoplanet had an
iron-rich atmosphere
i think we'd have to ask a chemist real
quick if that was actually viable you
have a star that had an eye on rich
atmosphere
um photosphere i don't think a planet
could maintain iron-rich atmosphere for
very long but that would be uh that
would be very much a chemist question
i'm afraid that that's
i would have problems about thinking but
you could actually keep it that way alan
crowley says
i didn't see construction of communities
factories or facilities at
l5 in the nss space road map
what infrastructure needs to be in place
before humanity is
in a position to construct things at l5
l4
uh the l4 and l5 points again being
usually meaning the the lagrange points
with the moon
and earth that are on all
triangle with uh with sorry an
equilateral triangle with ortho in the
moon
although you can also have the ones with
the sun which is the same thing with the
open sun instead
um biggest thing about those
is that you're theoretically used in
principle as launch points
um but um power supply
fuel production one of those two it
depends on what you're actually using as
your ship drive
um you can very easily start doing big
heavy infrastructure up there if you
either have
infrastructure on the moon for mining a
very big power satellite right around
earth
um or fusion power that's actually
reasonably practical
or if you just go ahead and say hey
we'll go with you know atomic power
classic fission in space
any one of those four it'd probably be
in the zone along with these sort of
hiking self-replicator
get one of those five or two of those
five
fairly decently you could probably
that'll probably you have to do that
infrastructure
see your episode kick starting space
industry for discussion of that topic
y'all styman says what would an eventual
solution
to the theory of everything bring to
science and humanity
i feel like that was a question we had
now do we have that one what would an
eventual solution to the theory of
everything bring to science and humanity
you know i was talking with brian
keating about that and yeah we did have
that question last live stream
um uh about that kind of concept loosely
he's one of the folks who has been
researching dark matter
um very good book by the way on that
topic by him um
uh losing the nobel prize um
we should probably make the book of the
month um but uh
a theory of everything to me is always
kind of chasing after an assumption
which is a bad thing in science you're
assuming an answer
theory of everything generally means in
in most contexts these days
unification of all the four physical
forces you know you already have the
electromagnetic force the weak and
strong nuclear force
and um gravity and we got a very good
linkage between the electromagnetic
strong
and weak nuclear forces and they are
fairly similar in power
you know and one's like 100 times more
powerful than the other but gravity is a
billion billion billion times weaker
than the weakest of those
um and has alien attractive force
and generally talk about a theory of
everything we're talking about ways to
link up the higgs boson
the big bang the inflationary cosmic
period and gravity
to link up to those other three forces i
don't think we should assume that there
actually necessary is awesome if there
isn't there's a good chance there is but
um i don't like to just kind of work on
that assumption obviously we do get
through everything
probably very good power generation
maybe a decent chance at being able to
create either stasis fields or gravity
or anti-gravity fields too
so we have a question from rational a
recent development of a mechanical
artificial wound for mice is promising
how would having a viable artificial
womb for humans affect humanity in the
near
and far future um
usually the big one for artificial wombs
is that i mean
one is one other alternative where birth
control is consulted you could
potentially be planned spanning
fetuses into machines if somebody was
not uncomfortable that pregnancy
uh but the other big one on that is that
you can start dealing with problem cases
um like pregnancies where the the
pregnancy is taking place inside the
tubes uh as opposed to the proper womb
or uh any sort of case where they just
rather be able to have access to the
baby
in the facility to kind of constantly
model but that's the big thing for
artificial whims i would say for humans
um for animals i'm not sure there really
is all that much of an advantage but
obviously it would have a lot of
scientific applications but i don't know
that that's
main medical one would probably just be
for telling problem situations of
pregnancies
a says dear isaac when will you do
another collaboration with john
michael godier
you guys are the best combo ever
i think i've probably done homes and me
collaborations with john as i have with
uh with joe scott
and frasier king combined and i've done
one one with uh with fragile quite a
while actually
um but uh and those are the two i've
collaborated with most most folks i've
done
one collab with maybe two um
and uh i mean i'm always i always love
going on john show john is a lot of fun
we will
talk for hours and hours after cut these
things up afterwards into
multiple episodes and even then leave a
lot out but um anytime he wants to be on
there with advanced notice i would say
uh he's one of those two i just love
chatting to you along with uh jimmy
choice from fade to black they're just
fun to talk to
so we had another question it says i
just need to know isaac
are you into skiing snowboarding or
i'll wait in the lodge uh
i'm not gone skiing that i can remember
i've never done snowboarding i do buy
screen with some bicycling yesterday
that was uh that was fun
a lot of uphill we made it almost 19
miles yeah
and mostly uphill we had to come back
down the hill afterwards
we have some very nice bike trails in
our area and the one we have here in
ashbury county the greenway trail was
built on top of a railroad track a
leftover railroad track without a
surface
and it runs north and south and it's
almost flat the whole way like the lake
beginner it's a very nice solid asphalt
very little crossings of like traffic
you can just relax and go on it
and then we went to presque island up in
the area it's a little more up down the
more crowded but also pretty flat
across to us the west in jia county
they've got was the maple
line the maple highlands trail up and
down i think it was it looks like a
stock market on a very very flat it also
is on a railroad track but they
called that hill the little mountain run
oh it's just flat a lot so
after we made it uphill for a solid mile
we started to
wonder if we were on the right trail
well i wish we hadn't saw that little
piece of it yeah but i have a beautiful
track i just it's very exhausting so um
let's see i've been trying to talk say
on scuba diving we do kayaking
i don't think we've have we thought
about doing those
i've skied before okay maybe at some
point i've never
done widow sports me or actually the
lodge yeah i go sit in front of the
fireplace and drink hot chocolate coffee
those are good for me
johnny wings says please please do a
world
tour giving talks about your techno
optimism
so many people are depressed about the
future these days also
come to ireland do you think there's any
good bike trails in ireland
well like i thought well there are no
mountains in ireland so there's
definitely
but yeah there's nothing but there's
hills like giaga county
i've never been there you could bike
with the sheep yeah that's scotland
we used to have a lot of sheep uh well
see i've been to most of the countries
in europe except ironically never to
ireland
and in england only to stop at heathrow
on a stopper for heathrow airport
but uh on our base that we had in geese
and germany just north of frankfurt
they'd bring sheep in to help keep
the grass down and uh they always let
them graze right by the track we'd go
jogging on
and uh well yeah well you know a lot
about sheep obviously and how much fun
is to walk in places that they've been
hanging out
so let them charge that could be
um we have a question from tp he says in
your predictions video you mentioned the
possibility of recording
every minute of our future lives what
kind of technology would it take to
record and re-watch
our dreams
[Applause]
we do have an episode on bcis coming up
that's that's actually discussed a
little bit more about how we'd actually
interface with neurons
um and i would say
i would want to check i am not actually
sure if our pseudo-uniportal
neurons those pseudoinopolo neurons are
the ones that mostly use for sensory
neurons
i don't know if they're actually
involved in um dream style
i'm not a neurologist maybe someone in
the chat knows the answer that if we do
you know stimulate those doll while
we're doing if that was the case you'd
actually have a pretty good chance of
just kind of like
putting the neuron equivalent of a dash
cam and all the their sensory neurons
and then just recording what they are
firing up
um but otherwise i'm not saying i'm sure
it should be possible
it's it's there's input there's stimuli
the actual process of actually trying to
digitize
anything that's going on your brain
though is very hard even we talk about
doing digitalization of humans what we
really mean is we're going to emulate
neurons digitally
and then just then you have to ask the
question of do you want to
and whether or not there's an erase
button should you
not want to see that anymore like brain
bleach that's that's
well that's actually another good
application that kind of software is you
know if you got something traumatic or
just unpleasant you don't want to
remember
you want to go ahead and delete that
that's potentially an option so
isaac bradeau says when will humanity
mine their first asteroid
in the next 20 years i'm confident in
the next 20 years we'll have that pilot
i wouldn't want to say within the next
10
i think that this would be a lot of
effort put into doing that uh
very soon but the practicality of
actually making that happen
things often as with the technological
development you can
suddenly have things roll forward really
fast and then hit a stopping point where
you thought you'd be able to hit it but
then just
really sticks as a brick wall like we
had that happen with fusion for instance
um we had that happen with um uh video
conferencing
i have a video conference we're starting
to be a big thing in the late 90s
already we'll try to do video
conferencing video education
and the only reason it's really finally
taken off i mean it's over easy for
years
it's zoom was not a new thing to me
right but uh for most people it really
was
and this ironically this plague has
helped us get that much better at doing
that and making people more comfortable
with that and now we're going to see a
big wave of improvement in that sort of
soft distance and things like that
from this but it's still two decades
after we started saying it's the wave of
the future any minute now
albert jackson says isaac 2020 has gone
by fast and in episodes you've talked
about the changing perception of how we
experience things via brain alteration
how would that change the thought around
time itself
one more time on that last piece of
question i believe it's kind of getting
at
um our changing perception and brain
alteration
changing time itself or our thoughts
around time itself um
that's hard to say again a lot of times
when we talk about speeding up time
we're talking about is frame jacking
when we say that we're going to speed up
your
the rate at which you think thus time
seems to pass by slower as a result
or slowing it down the other way so you
can experience long space voyages
slowly and i do not know if the tone
definitely originates from density
taylor i haven't asked him
um frame jacking but uh that's that's
why i'm most familiar from is desi
taylor's
we are legion novels which if you have
not read you know
great and delicious a good friend and a
great author also
but um back when they first started
doing trains
uh coming back to trains again popular
topic today there was a big focus
they're going so fast that you know that
was too fast for a human to experience
you know not so much a scientific zone
but consort the public once we get that
one painting i think by wheeler maybe
that shows the melting clocks they're
like all twisted and fold over
um time perception though should not
really be changed by
your mind but then at the same time
there's time the passing object you know
under relativity einstein and then
there's
your perception of time so that can
absolutely be affected by modern
augmentation
arkiger thank you for your donation we
really appreciate it
he says what is your opinion on the ai
safety alignment problem for the near
term
i love the channel keep up the great
work
um i mean i would actually say the
biggest threat
from ai in the near future is just that
they are released good at sodium data
i'm not really worried about google
getting small you know as i think we all
talked about that not that long ago um
was it like lobsters have six neurons
that control almost everything they do
humans have 100 billion we all we have
ai that are smaller than that now but at
the same time
our ai are still really dumb we have ai
but they are dumb
google is not alive you know google is
not thinking but at the same time
their ability to analyze data for stuff
that we just underlined we have to look
at to be able to just find out things
about you you'd find very uncomfortable
for black male material
for social coercion things like that is
the biggest threat for
employ for employing and deploying ai in
the near future
is just how well can that be used to
sort data
to find things out that would be a
violation of privacy in most people's
eyes
so speaking of ai we have a question do
you think movies like the matrix
terminator or other movies which
antagonize ai
will seem offensive when there are
sentient ai in the future
now but uh i just got around to watching
the newest tomato movie
um which i didn't even she known was
alex i don't really watch previews that
i think i thought the
newest one was genesis was the dark fate
one i was really disappointed in that
film it was
i really think the most recent good uh
sequel to tomorrow films has probably
been salvation i kind of enjoyed the
premise there
um i like to say iconic
i know chronicles though better but uh
antagonist ai
i don't think they are going to care if
we are
doing things they're confused with their
concern because you the thing to keep in
mind with ai
is they're not a species it's not that
type of thing with ai they're all
different you know it's it's like saying
are things about pigs going to be
insulting to ascension birds in the
future
i don't think google is going to be
offended by us knocking apple in the
future
it'd be kind of like us knocking eagles
we're talking to pigeons
it's going to be a very broad area as to
whether or not they will get offended
i can only really imagine one of them we
have said about things we're talking
about nowadays or in science fiction as
either an excuse to
want us to humanize it which is probably
a valid thing look at all these problems
you've had in the past that
all basically has an excuse for cassius
belly i wiped them out because they say
offensive things about me
they were my predecessors then probably
not it's real reason for doing them
you know so you'll get a good reminder
how antagonized they feel about that
though
dragon king says will you do a video on
the new warp
drive um
actually yes yes i will do that video we
are doing a new ftl series i don't
forget about that that is not the first
one we're doing the first one is was it
um i can't what the episode is called
it's coming
we have a new series coming up in june
called galactic domination
and i thought it was a great time since
that's so often intrinsically with ftl
to discuss the you know doing some more
ftl episodes because i was never really
happy with the original series
it was very early on in production and
they're not best quality episodes and
there was always a desire to be more on
that topic so yes we will be looking at
the new warp drive
sometime this year annabelle casa says
what do you think is the far
future of gaming like galactic gaming
gaming gaming galactic
gaming wouldn't there be a time lag
between
i mean it would be a huge lag time if
you're trying to do anything but with
unless you have fashion like travel uh
it'd be hard to do when you've inside
the solar system like they do with a lot
of
multiplayer role-playing games um
i do very little online gaming in
general because
i remember whenever quest first came out
this world warcraft hit the warcraft
online the warcraft one and two i did
play
um and i just i had quite a few geeky
friends who got obsessed with that game
so uh
massive online role play games all
things i tend to avoid like the plague i
find pen and paper rpgs or sandbox style
games where i play video games all these
days which is savvy a lot less often
than i would probably like to
um and uh so i'm not really going to be
good at predicting what the next trends
of those are
if i was i would probably
patent them make a ton of money off them
instead
um you know it's always hard to predict
what the
trends are going to be in gaming on
those but uh
i wouldn't be the guy for that because
to me i still play games like 2006 and i
still remember found the
nintendo games like the early 90s late
80s
so kenneth landert says
are you involved in the search for the
ninth planet
which one qualifies the ninth plant
these days i guess that would be a no
yeah well i mean
if you have to stop and think about it
yeah um
it's always nice and there are going to
be more planet-sized objects in the
solar system some of which are probably
planets on the official international
unofficial international astronomical
you know
unions definition i i find the taxonomy
of planets to be really
kind of silly to be honest um
pluto's always been a plan to me it's
because it's been my whole life it's
still planned to be i just think it was
series and sedna and
orcis and makamake and hawami and aerys
as plants too
however only the ones that are
interesting actually to be promoted
planet
people who live on these things down the
road are going to call them plants too
they're not gonna be like oh i live on
the dwarf planet of sirius like i live
on planet serious now
you're dating yourself someone wants to
know how old you are but
uh 26. and counting
this is an interesting name it says
divide by zero get cake
yes
thank you um
hey isaac what space mission within the
next 10 years excites you the most
asteroid mining to be honest uh i'd love
to go back to the moon but i i do think
of asteroid mine yes as the big one that
would be
what i'd really like to see uh anything
that puts boots on the ground on the
moon would be nice
but really only if it's there with the
intent of it being permanent
right um a moon base would excite me but
otherwise asteroid mining is the big one
for me
so you take uh one more question before
we go to break i think
okay this one is from bionic pun are you
ever going to do a genocidal aliens
episode
one that passed it's on that the
solution to the fermi paradox is an evil
race of alien murderers that thinks the
universe belongs exclusively to them
yes see our galactic domination series
this this summer
[Laughter]
we're going to break real quickly back
in a few minutes it's a great time to
grab a drink of snack and get some more
questions
in so we're on break for a few minutes
and it's a good time to grab a drink and
a snack
and get some more questions and draw
moderators for part two
while we're taking a quick break i want
to follow up on a question that gets
raised a lot in discussion of lago life
spans
and post-scarcity or advanced
civilizations like those we've been
discussing of late
and that's what happens when you start
running out of room for memory
the interesting thing about it is that
we would assume someone losing their
memories would be losing some vital
piece of themselves
but i'm not entirely sure that's true we
have discussed before the concept of
identity as a continuity of memory and
experience
but while we are definitely influenced
by our experiences how much the specific
memory them impacts us as a critical
feature of personality
is a little bit debatable and that's
important because we use terms like
identity or personality
in the context of radical changes to
lifespan personal augmentation or
civilization changing events
they're not idle or semantic ponderings
we still consider someone themselves
even if they have amnesia and in point
of fact there are four recognized types
of amnesia one of which is infantile or
childhood amnesia and most people cannot
remember the first three to five years
of life
there's a clue in there because while
folks change a lot as they age
they are to have a fairly developed
personality by that age
which tends to remain there for life in
spite of not remembering the events that
caused it
and few of us really remember things in
true detail
even something as recent and overt as
what color tie someone was wearing who
you spoke to face to face
for 10 minutes last week it's probably
not right to say that we distilled down
conversations or events for critical
info
but something along those lines seems to
be the case and the analogy that comes
to mind is a scientific experiment
if you've been involved in one of those
even a fairly brief one of a few hours
then you know that all that you need
from it is often as little as a table of
a few dozen measurements linked to times
or trials or similar
like if you're measuring how tall a
plant grew over several days
from when you planted its seed think
about everything that went on during
that time in that lab
like you grabbing some coffee or
chatting life events with your lab
partner
or sweeping up some broken glass when
you bumped beaker off the table
none of that is really relevant to your
data and d that data isn't really
relevant to some grand scientific theory
developed from it
we don't really care about the several
thousand stars whose spectra
mass and brightness were measured to
determine how mass impacts star
lifetimes
we just care about the conclusion and
that might be an analogy for most
memories and our personality
losing those memories later doesn't
change the personality any more than
losing the tables of data for that
seedling or those stars would
in the context of people needing a
purpose for their existence in a
high-tech utopia of extended lifespans
picking up some skills is when we think
of allowing enjoying life events and
losing your memory of them to limited
storage would seem to hurt that motive
but the personality changes they brought
on are likely to be preserved
another thing to consider is the same as
we don't keep memories of our earliest
childhood
a post-human or very long-lived
individual might regard lifetime one
so to speak as just another childhood
compared to their vastly extended life
of course extending and improving human
memory will be a big goal of future
biotechnology and brain computer
interfaces
topics we'll be looking at this spring
if you'd like to help future episodes of
our show like those
you can donate to us on patreon or at
our website isaacarthur.net
linked in this episode's description and
now
back to our show
and we're back well we have
a lot of questions so i'm going to jump
right in with one from the thatcher
when we talk about putting people's
consciousness into a machine
i always hear about scanning and in
essence copying
the person and not actually transferring
is it possible to slowly replace a
person's brain bit by bit with tech that
does the same
tasks as the parts replaced so that the
original person is in the computer at
some point
probably i think a lot of these ones um
this comes back to that season ship
or these shipping notions of the
pronunciation that is if i have a ship
and i i'm replacing little bits of it
here and there at what point in time
have i replaced the entire ship or is it
still the original ship if every
component is not one that was originally
there
well your body replaces components all
the time but the counter on that is is
usually if i make synthetic neurons and
mind you these might not be metal they
could just be clone
neuron copies with your own dna just
like your own body mix
or restored ones are perfect copies of
these actual neurons
if you deal with these digital uploads
you can also repair that normal brain
probably
indefinitely too um
if your brains replace them anyway you
know you say well that probably is the
original person
it says this gradual approach though um
seriously building people are much more
comfortable with is the gradual one
where we slowly replacing things or
slowly copying you partly over a
computer that might be in your head
for instance just like an implanted chip
and at some point we pulled the chip and
all your brains there
the counter of that is if i could do
that over a century and you still the
original person
what's the machine century in a second
if that already means replacing these
things if you're still the same person
it's done
and that's the whole continuity of
identity issue that we come and discuss
so often on this topic
so we don't know the answer thank you
zottle for your donation and zadl says
thank you for your out of this world
videos
thank you we have a question from
alexander
hey isaac how are you do you believe
we'll find more big dwarf planets in our
solar system like pluto
uris or humaya oh yeah yeah
almost without a shadow of doubt um
there will be
plenty of them in the house i think
that's going back to our discussion
before the break about
what's classified as a planet probably
uh whether or not we find something
really big like a saturn or jupiter and
i'd say probably not anything that big
but eating earth size or smaller
i'd say there's pretty snods of one in
the outer or not the outer world cloud
it probably is but you know
just out within 200 years of the system
probably
gule de cot says if jwst launches
and images planets with life but no
techno signatures
do you think this will unify humans or
dishearten them
for we are likely very unique
i think that if we found a bunch of
planets with without techno sensors but
with clear signs of life
i think that would probably just push us
towards wanting to colonize the galaxy
faster
um i don't think that'll really change
our perception of things
um you know we we have basically two
constant warning schools of thought
are we special are we unique and no not
social no we're not unique
and those are deep philosophical
questions that we're kind of constantly
always trying to answer both directions
because
if you go too far down the run road
that's pride narragans
uh if you go too far down the other road
you're kind of removing that
collective will to thrive so um yes
i think if we find a bunch of plants out
techno sanchos it would push us towards
me out in the galaxy
thank you uh for the new donations
coming in on the super chat we
appreciate that
and we have a question here from
goofball mon
good afternoon isaac i have a question
what would happen if the fermi paradox
was completely wrong
and life and in particular intelligent
life was way more common than we
originally thought
well i mean the issue of the fermi
paradoxes is that it's not really
subject to being wrong that way
um we don't know where life is it might
be that they're all a little green
alien's actually visiting us right now
that's a possible solution for me
paradox is that
the question is why does it seem like
there should be a lot of intelligent
life but it doesn't seem like there
actually is
and hiding is definitely one of the
viable solutions for that i just don't
think it's a very
viable one um and
uh i don't know i think
if we found that life really was very
common intelligent absolutely common
the biggest question is is it temporary
or is it hanging around
and if it the most depressing answer to
me in some ways would be that it
actually hangs around space opera style
because
all those civilizations seem really neat
for a book or two but then you start
looking at them and they seem so
stagnant
you know if if the civilizations are
getting wiped out non-stop that's pretty
depressing
right because like wow we've hit the
stage we've gotten a few rocket ships
lost we've colonized the planet and then
we wiped ourselves out
that's pretty depressing if that's what
happens in 99.99 civilizations
because life is common doesn't hang
around in some ways though it's just as
depressing me to think that
life has been appearing on the scene
with intelligence for a billion years on
on a million plans in this galaxy alone
and none of them have ever actually
really gotten around doing a thing
um in terms of like any of the stuff we
usually think of for the factual fate of
the galaxy
so i hope the answer is no
okay so we have a question here from sam
daniel jones
one thing about o'neill type habitats
has long puzzled me
could you simulate winter in one without
resorting to mechanically produced
oxygen
given how they're too small to have a
summer side
for neal cylinders you could certainly
have a somewhere in a winter
in there um i'll give you an example on
a disc planet
one of the discord coin plants we talk
about it has the same season of the
whole thing because there's no coach of
the plant right so every
every part of the side facing the sun is
getting the exact same amount of light
of sun
you can tilt the thing anyway right but
and that just controls how much light
the things individual surface areas are
getting
but it's the same for the guidance up at
the top as it is down at the bottom
right
uh with the curve plans you change the
amount of light that's hitting this
surface here gets less than
you know this surface here um and
uh you could do that with o'neill
habitat it's spinning out but you have
to kind of it so it gets different
seasons
if you're like lighting down the middle
um but
you can do weather patterns inside on
your cylinders
it's just that they all tend to be a
little bit more artificial you know
you're not going to have the
tootsie to plant the same way because
it's not sphere but if you're looking
for what that might look like
by inverse dig uh from spacehabs.com did
some really very nice christmas shots
for his
complaint on one um habitat that had
snow so
ninja q says does the orbital ring have
to meet the equator at two points or is
it possible to somehow stretch across
one hemisphere exclusively
you can do an awful lot with an orbital
ring that is not exactly natural
the stables place to have one is around
the equator not two points for the whole
thing but you can tilt an ankle make it
elliptical
things like that when you start trying
to make it not across the equator two
points though what would not be a stable
circular elliptical orbit around the
planet things start getting a lot
trickier but you gotta keep in mind
what's holding an opening up is magnets
you can call the motion or anything with
a magnet
it does not have to be a naturally
moving structure so you could do some
kind of weird
curvy train track if you really wanted
to at that point though you're probably
better off just putting a bunch of space
tiles on a very
long track and i think he might as you
also have to turn things while they're
moving on the tracks you can't do these
sharp torns
i think flax would like to answer this
question the question is from barry on
would a theory of everything include
cats it's
i think the cat's buried underneath the
camera shot throughout there it's just
flying
how do you sneak back in here is that
with mountainly well he decided that
treats made a great start for a nap is
he in the camera
well i just took the valve camera i
think he wants to answer that question
what was the question again
would the theory of everything include
cats well would have to if it's
everything
uh and since cats do tend to think of
themselves as the center of the universe
i should think that um
definitely paying attention to that he
just peaked his eye yeah oh it's because
yeah the cat told us there was a captain
in my office i've been
trying this out that was a really stupid
idea for a year now so
i don't even seem to sneak back in
definitely feels that he's the center of
the universe
well he's a cat s p roach says how hard
would it be to put a giant paracel into
the earth
soul l1
i mean for a given value of easy uh it's
probably easier to put a big one almost
one that would actually shade the entire
planet
than to build one full sized o'neill
cylinder because you're talking about
basically
putting a thin layer of aluminum foil up
i assume um
so probably probably you could do it uh
pretty easily
think of it as something on paul
depending on how much you want to do
with building the first
decent sized space habitat i see someone
says cats
chain shaped our minds well apparently
their brain parasites put your head too
okay melancholy says could there ever be
a fear of kessler syndrome with dyson
swarms on the upper limit
in terms of what the star can support
quite probably um
i think your biggest concern with dyson
swarms in terms of castle syndrome would
ironically be one way it was mostly
uh mostly a power collector or the thin
thin ones like the chicago thruster
round and one that was mostly habitats
are those you got a lot more mass play
with so you can put a lot more defensive
things in place a lot more things like
armor
but uh i think for the power collector
ones that would be a big concern would
be
uh kessler center around those which is
a cloud of debris around the solar
system in this case
so nobel what is the future of
non-lethal weaponry should we expect
something like asthma's neuronic
excuse me neuronic whip to be invented
uh for those who don't know in the
foundation series a neuronic whip is a
weapon
uh actually it's more just the
foundations there's as we use a few
times but
it's a weapon that basically causes you
know maximum pain to someone you shoot
with them and it's very
much like the criminal tear gas in that
thing or
uh we have some weapons like that though
sound weapons i think we were talking
about them
in an episode that probably hasn't come
out yet what would be coming up that
would have that
episode we were definitely talking about
non-lethal weapons though and
and sound as one of those one of those
um but something could actually
stimulate your neurons like that
probably um you should be able to
actually do that without having
invasive devices too because you can
wirelessly stimulate a brain see which
you can wirelessly read one so perhaps
yeah
that'd be hard charlata will governments
continue to lead space exploration or is
the future
corporate now that spacex has led the
way
um i'd say both
uh governments are almost always going
to be your best way to actually like
if people have an enthusiastic mode for
it you know that they can just say we
want to do a big
project that maybe is not going to be
economically viable initially over the
long term
that tends to be where government stuff
tends to be very handy also stuff where
you need to
do stuff that maybe not everyone's going
to agree on uh we were talking bike
trailers earlier
that's how to do privately because
there's so much provided way stuff there
you almost have to have
a government doing some eminent domain
here and there to be able to put some of
that together
um so as whether we have more corporate
stuff in it that we hope i would hope so
um i don't think there's really a
scenario for there being less government
involvement in space
uh so much as there's a good chance for
a lot of private development
and hopefully for a lot of uh you know
non-profit and individual stuff too our
goal
our ideal goal for the geeks that we all
uh is to be able to have the millennium
falcon to have that personal spaceship
that you can rent out and take to
another planet so that's the end goal
you know forget about renting out they
want to own it you want to buy one
drawd says would you like to do a
collaboration with neil degrasse tyson
um needle glass tyson i i mean
he's obviously a great educator of great
science communicator
i always enjoy working with almost even
from that area but
i don't know him personally so um
usually if someone asks me to do a
collaboration with them i say yes you
know it's it's uh
one of those things where i don't really
go out and solicit if they ask me then
i'm usually glad to do so
that'll noddle if a star was warped
someplace close to us will we detect its
gravity
of that star or will we see its light
first gravity and light move the same
speed to the best of our knowledge they
both move at the speed of light or speed
of information that's something we'll
talk about more in
the ftl series when we get that first
episode which i think was
called breaking reality or something
like that cheating cheating reality and
that's
coming up in about two months yeah i
think it was uh
no it wouldn't be on the monthly
schedule yeah i don't think okay remark
how long will i need to live to get to
live indefinitely
uh longevity uh we have to call this
takeoff speed um
if you're making people live a little
longer every year
at what point in time are you far enough
ahead in time that you could expect that
will
will start improving lifespan faster and
people are aging out
i think you're probably if you're in
your 20s or younger you're probably
already there
i wouldn't care to speak about everybody
who is older than that so
but probably getting that point it's
technology that is
to me something we will get in the 21st
century or we'll have
very close rodney says do you think
deep mind's protein folding ai could be
the answer to the fermi paradox
a technology we can resist that kills us
i asked me in the comments afterwards
i'll get back to that question i
would want to think on that a little bit
more i'm not sure if i understood it
correctly so
okay sam daniel jones says do you think
intelligent super objects like jupiter
brains
will be necessary for us to nail down
complex technology or physics
or will they merely speed things up
three things though
um i would say with all those things if
we're talking about just being a faster
computer
uh those always help us figure things
out but if we actually talk about
jupiter brain which you seem not so much
to be a computer as a
brain then you're not really us in that
case anymore it's
that thing which is doing it and i don't
think it's going to like to be a tool
thank you merv johnson for your super
chat and your donation
and merv's question today is how goes
your quest to conquer the world as an
evil ai via donations
um
i would say that it's impressive how
much i mean as you can see today
we've just got so much better at that
emulation technology
i really feel like a a real boy now and
not just like a puppet
thank you both annabel casaus says can
you talk about what life would be like
in a type 3 civilization
i don't know if you'd ever really have a
type 3 civilization without fashion
light travel
that is again one of those things we
talked about in a little bit in the
upcoming galactic domination series
but uh i mean we never want to assume
that a type three civilization
is any type of specific civilization we
but we've talked about the culture of
scale we really only talk about the
amount of power they have access to
and that means they have access to
something in the vicinity of a billion
to a trillion
sons worth of power you know they're
that much of a dyson sphere on crack
and uh i generally don't think that it's
going to be a you you know
a unified civilization i honestly
wouldn't expect you in the case of k2
civilizations
because you know we're not even k1 yet
and we've never been unified nor do i
really expect us to be so
it could be eating up all of them halo
pitter says if you could make decisions
for space exploration for the next 30
years
what missions and technology
advancements would you recommend
30 years is a long time i mean they're
being really generous with that yeah i
try to think about what was going on 30
years ago
um we were still in the middle of the
shuttle program uh
we're kind of recovering from challenger
still um
there really you know was no taco really
going back to the moon i was really
upset about how we weren't
getting any progress on the moon um
it's just impressively about how much
has changed since then it's
it's it's very different but at the same
time it's a lot of stuff is still very
much the same
um what i do in the next 30 years
there would be four things i would i
would
really want to really have on the radar
that what they are
done or or you know mission really built
up a way to launch any point not be
theoretical
and and mars is not on that list of four
the first would be
getting us back to the opponent base the
second beginning as a space station and
these don't have to be in order by the
way
guinness space station that could
actually have a hundred people on it at
a time and usually did
probably at least one rotating section
that emulated either moon or mars
gravity
uh the third would be some kind of
actual economic setup they are
even it was prototyping stuff it was
like prototype space farms prototype
power satellites
whatever it is things slowly improving
to be able to get those to the point of
being economical
you know trying out those programs new
metallurgy projects for instance that
were being done in microgravity
but probably with a big focus on power
satellites for instance and
that fourth one would be asteroid mining
both for terms of precious metals
back home and for actually extracting
construction materials
to be used in building up there okay we
have a question from
atsa narvian sorry if i mispronounced
that one
when do you think we could reasonably
build an orbital
ring as in if we didn't focus solely on
it and developed and expanded otherwise
too um you know as well as ones of
technology versus practical usage
we could build one now but we wouldn't
right
same as they could have built a railroad
uh in 1760
right they didn't have any reason to
build them yet then they're not in 1600
right um you build an orbital ring when
you have a demand for it because there's
prototyping there's not that right
it's not the basic technology is run
some particle that's subject to magnetic
fields
uh through a big long magnetic tube very
easy technology it's how you order
televisions worked it's how a bunch of
appliances work that's how a vacuum tube
works
we have that technology we need to do
that and then scale up a billion fold in
terms of particles going through it
and we need to get all that stuff so we
can do it up in space as one big long
continuous section
um to do that to go through all the
prototyping and make it economical
you have to have a demand for it and
until we're ready to start putting a
thousand
to ten thousand people into space every
single day
you just don't do it and that so you
have to it's it's
gotta follow in that's why i always say
the open ring is like a train
you don't build a train out to colonize
the west coast
you send the folks in the covered wagons
on the oregon trail
um then when there are big cities there
that's when you build the train track
there the safety opener ring
you build that there when there's a lot
of folks there
i think this question kind of ties in
quite a bit to that
conversation and the one on tech three
uh type civilizations
hiroshi uh thank you for your super chat
and your donation and he says can there
be a
low lut a low-tech type three
civilization sure you could have a
no-tech
uh culture of three civilization uh
we're looking at low-tech kosher two
civilizations
um we've looked at biotechnology space
whales things like that yeah you could
have a zero tech
um cartons of three let's say that we
have a a basic panspermia device some
creature that's able to survive a ten
thousand year journey through space very
simple micro
and it's capable of creating a life
cycle that is i absorb sunlight i eat
asteroids i create some kind of
thin foil membrane thing that absorbs
sunlight and eats asteroids
and we turn a whole solar system into
one big power collector
and that is how we also spent our spores
out to other solar systems
that is a no-tech commercial three
civilization
all that matters to your culture of
three civilization from this perspective
is
are you using a large portion or the
entirety of
the power output of the stars in a
galaxy
and that could be done very low tech
we have a uh super chat from demes
recon b4 thank you daimez
and says i'm late but i love the streams
if we do find
life or evidence of life on mars what
are the odds that it's related to life
here
such as panspermia
pretty big to be honest um well let me
rephrase that
when we start looking at the plants and
see if there's actually life on all
these other plants if there are tons of
plants without techno signatures
um it's obviously you still want to go
actually visit those places and start
putting dna on them if we did find that
but you can transfer material between
earth and mars and i would say that
there'd be a pretty good chance we found
something on mars that it was
transplanted from earth
or vice versa or maybe from europa um
that just depends on where it is that
your a biogenesis events take place at
um we just talked about that no tech
scenario one of them was that maybe
you know about a billion years in the
universe's age some very simple life was
cooked up and sprayed all over the
entire galaxy
so common origin there perhaps but we
just don't know we need a lot more
science and we need actual boots on the
ground always supposed to really
be able to say that with any sort of
salty at all
daniel mckayla says hey isaac have you
heard about something called
moist greenhouse from what i understand
it is similar to a runway greenhouse
runaway greenhouse effect
like with venus but the oceans simmer
instead of boiling
i tend to be very dubious of some of the
atmospheric models that that would imply
that you could boil a planet
at earth's distance without extreme
artificial intent to do so
um it's possible maybe but
i really don't think you could have a
runaway effect like with venus because i
don't think that venus was a runaway
greenhouse effect
i think that uh we don't have enough
information to say why venus is super
hot like that but
the biggest key thing of course with
venus is that it rotates once a year
pretty much and that it is actually a
lot closer to the sun than we are
um you could have a lot of effects from
screwing out the atmosphere of a planet
but
we also want to be a little bit careful
assuming that those can peek off to
cause a plant to be like mercury or
venus when it's out as far as earth is
i'm not first looking at the moist
greenhouse effect but i don't think
you'll boil the ocean off the spot
without actually
applying something about the line of a
car non-stop nuclear detonations across
the planet or
lots of solar meals i'm going to combine
a couple questions here
from arkanoid and von neely
so basically the first part is what kind
of civilization
would you go for when playing stellaris
wide
tall federation conquest what extension
path would you take
and then the flip side of that is what
are the most strategic planetary bodies
from a military's perspective
um you know in terms of any of the 4x
space games where you're talking solaris
or you know i tend to date back to the
old master or eye and move
two days and uh galactic empire's days
go galactic civilizations days
or star wars rebellion for those who go
really far back for that one too
i never played the same strategy twice
that you actually engineer race i
always shifted around i you know i'd
always go custom
um usually i played with the basic
default human race was or had a story
one of the ones that had the following
storyline and whether it was done i just
changed around each time to see what the
difference was
um and then ask what plants are what
plant types are most militarily
strategic
um
plants as a rule are not going to be
your best places to
be doing military buildups from this way
you build your stuff maybe or where you
are funneling things around or what
you're trying to protect but
they do have the downside they are not
mobile um except a very
extreme case where you're moving very
slowly like planner ships but
as to which ones are more strategic
wherever there is value there is
something people might want to take or
damage to deny access to you
therefore the most strategic plants are
the most valuable plants which is always
going to be
based on where is your population or
what's your technology best answer i can
give on that one for now
ask me again in a thousand years
um this one reminds me of a game as well
that's from three black one red
this reminds me of that uh game that
we've been playing with the
code and d code oh uh mastermind yes
mastermind
um anyway thank you three black one red
mastermind
for your donation and they'd like to
know can cryptocurrencies overcome its
energy usage
problem and thoughts on the long-term
viability
i know you have a couple episodes on
cryptocurrencies yeah it's the one i
think i did on that one from way back
um and thank you for the folks who
donated cryptocurrency
to the channel at that time oh so
thank you very much um but charles
strauss uh
a lot of episodes like uh singularity
sky
and uh a few sorry well charles strauss
uh from excel under a bunch of other
sci-fi books wrote a very interesting
article on cryptocurrency way back
it's a little dated but that's a good
one to discuss that energy issue thing
um i don't know if any individual
specific cryptocurrency system one
specific one could do but remember
you're allowed to create as many
cryptocurrency types as you want you
don't have to limit yourself just to
bitcoin or ethereum you can make
many of them and you can tie those
together under one blanket title
um is to the energy mining issue on that
one
the biggest concern on that one is
always how much
uh energy is worth that amount of money
eg are you basically
spending tons of energy on it and i
think a thing to keep in mind with that
because it really is a big concern at
what point does it get to be too
ridiculous in terms of the
energy usage uh is how much we cost to
print money these days because
frequently it costs more to make a penny
than a penny cost right a dollar bill
cost was like four cents to print and
they last for a year and a half
there's a big cost of actual money uh in
terms of printing
or in terms of usage in general and so
the question is always gonna be for
economic viability of that we won't know
until we've been using as a major
currency for quite some time but my
guess is that yes there's something you
can tackle
i know we're running out of time but i
want to slide in a few more questions
here
under the wire joseph jostar says hello
isaac what do you think about the warp
drive as an
answer to faster than light travel anton
petrov recently made a good video about
the topic have you seen that
a lot of good videos um and uh
i have not seen that one though we will
look more at the warp drive i think
later this year so that we did do an
episode on the alcubierre world drive
years back
it's time to look at the topic more but
i'll save commentary on that for now
for a later episode and then i guess do
we have other questions
um i'd like to give a shout out to rob
boze for his
super chat three black one red for
another super chat and henry myers for
their super chat
and i have three questions left if we
have time for that
okay also a super chat from mostly
folders a little bit of everything
thank you so much for your donation
finding some cash in those folders
can our advancement over the next
century happen without people suffering
being left behind a rising tide to lift
all boats or not
i think with the tide advisors if your
boat doesn't have giant holes in it
you're generally going to rise up
um whether or not you can raise a
standard living for everybody
which should be the goal is to raise a
standard living depends on
basically one is the ethics of the
cultural focus on doing that do you want
to raise people up and the other one is
what is your basis for doing that ag
how are you raising love if your answer
is just to give them money that may not
be the best approach in some cases
you're trying to raise things
up you'll get i i hate to focus on
maslow's aiki so much when we talk about
post scarcity because there's
so much debate about the accuracy of
that thing but it's a good one that's
popular
people have a lot of needs a lot of
goals and aspirations
and we should never be focused on just
trying to fulfill one of those
you want to make people better and that
is not just about prosperity but it will
come
you know you want to raise prosperity up
but i never think of raising has to be
in a more prosperous society as their
actual goal very more of a consequence
of other goals
of making us better more thoughtful type
of people
so i'm going to combine a couple here
how long until the earth's core goes
cold
and which is easier terraforming or gene
editing to adapt to a new planet
uh terraforming because
genomine is going to really be limited
to where you find things are very like
earth you're not going to gene edit a
human to be able to live on the moon uh
naturally
um uh and then what was the other
calendar for a quarter cool off
a very long time um i mean check out
you'd have to look up the actual wattage
coming off the earth's core is right now
but i think it's around
to 14 watts plus a minus order of
magnitude there
um then just remember that's basically
the binding energy plant which about 10
to 30.
so probably something like 10 to 16
seconds give or take two orders of
magnitude uh and there's like
several billion years probably several
billion years which sounds about right
anyway but someone had to run those
numbers i can't quite do those ones in
my head
probably not for the summer boss out
last question for today
from uh www
thank you for your super chat of 10 and
he says if space is expanding faster
than the speed of light does that fact
make it
infinite by default
no no uh it would mean it was infinite
over an infinite period of time
but uh it we would not necessarily know
that it was infinite now
it might be infinite right now but a
finite thing that is expanding
infinitely longly
still needs an infinite amount of time
to do so so
uh in terms of that it would get there
eventually after an infinite period of
time took place
so a great trick question is that yes i
did want to give a quick shout out
because i've got some of the ones
feeding up here for the the
super chats i think we didn't get a
chance to get to and there was one from
horse the great that's been sticking
there on my screen forever it says
is comorog for mohamed 40k possible or
is science fancy on steroids
and yes that is definitely science fancy
on steroids like a pocket dimension full
of evil monsters so
warhammer 40k is a great series it
should never be taken in scientifically
realistic and near respect
um as you know i'm sorry if we missed
your question going through these today
hopefully some more um feel free to put
them down in the
uh comments below do make sure you put
them down in there if you want me to in
a day or two because the ones that are
in the chat
once we shut the video off for the day
you can't reply to anyone in the chat
after that so you do need to copy them
down the comments below and i will try
to get them next couple of days
though today is my anniversary and
tomorrow i'm closing my house there may
be a bit of a delay
anyway thank you everyone so much for
joining us today uh thank you sarah for
being our question answer and ask for
today
thank you sindreen and some of the
others who are helping your questions to
us from chat
