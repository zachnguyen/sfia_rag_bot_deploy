China Brain Hive Minds
The China Brain thought experiment assumes it 
might be possible for a computer or person to  
emulate a human brain neuron or several of 
them, and that therefore a large number of  
people sitting at desks calculating away 
could simulate an animal or even human  
brain same as any sufficiently advanced 
computer could. China was chosen as it  
had the largest human population at the 
time and since there is already another  
concept for world or planet brains. If we can 
emulate or upload a human mind on a computer,  
then a large enough room full of people running 
calculations, or insects moving simple switches,  
should enable us to emulate a human brain.
And if these folks are effectively neurons  
in a simple brain, do they count as a type of 
hive mind? If insects emulate a smarter brain,  
are they a hive mind, and if a room of humans 
emulates a simple animal brain, much dumber  
than each of them, is this still a hive mind.
