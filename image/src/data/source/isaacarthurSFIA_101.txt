One approach to colonizing space is to skip 
on trying to find planets of roughly Earth  
size and gravity and instead build space 
habitats that rapidly rotate to simulate  
gravity by centrifugal force, or spin gravity, 
and this is often accomplished with a ring  
or cylinder but these need to be very big to 
be at all Earthlike and structural materials  
like steel only allow so much size. With the 
discovery of Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene,  
structures like McKendree’s Cylinder and Forrest 
Bishop’s Ring were imagined, potentially over a  
thousand miles wide and offering as much living 
area as a continent. Perhaps most interestingly,  
this structure can be open to space so long 
as it has rim walls or mountain ranges on the  
edge to keep air from spilling out, as its 
atmosphere clings to its inner surface and  
thins with altitude, just like on a planet.

habitats, see our episode,
