In our recent episode, Atmospheric Mining, we 
discussed ways to mine the skies of planets,  
moons, and even stars, and spent a lot 
of time on Titan, the only moon in our  
solar system with any significant atmosphere.
Titan is Saturn’s largest moon and a good deal  
bigger than our own Moon, which is fifth, 
behind Titan and three of Jupiter’s Moons,  
Ganymede, Callisto, and Io. Indeed Titan and 
Ganymede are both larger than planet Mercury. 
But which of those two is bigger? Ganymede wins 
by mass, but size is tricky because Titan appears  
wider when measured to include its atmosphere, and 
only later did we find its surface was much deeper  
down under the thick atmosphere. Given that the 
episode was on Atmospheric Mining I felt it fair  
to give Titan that qualified win, but we measure 
this way for gas giants like Jupiter or Saturn,  
or even our Sun. It may be an important legal 
question for future endeavors like mining too,  
where does a planet begin, or 
a moon or star for that matter?
