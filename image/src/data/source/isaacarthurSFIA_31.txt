During the late 19th and early 20th century 
many people believed there were canals on Mars,,  
and this fueled many excellent sci-fi stories. 
But as time went on and astronomy improved,  
we saw that the canal effect itself was a mix 
of optical illusion and natural geological  
formations. Perhaps ancient natural remnants 
of when Mars previously had more water billions  
of years ago. This might have permitted 
life to flourish there in ancient times  
and perhaps even some remnants to remain today.
However, newer models and experiments simulating  
martian atmosphere mix and temperatures indicate 
that carbon dioxide, which moves directly from  
gas to solid and back again, what’s called 
sublimation, may be much more explosive in  
the low pressure atmosphere of Mars, which is 
mostly carbon dioxide. Causing it to freeze in  
colder times and explosively erupt in warmer ones, 
potentially making the canals and indicating the  
Red Planet may have been less blue and habitable 
than once thought, even in primordial times.
