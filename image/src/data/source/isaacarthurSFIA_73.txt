Neutron Stars are what is usually leftover 
after a big star explodes as a Supernova,  
but fortunately for us these stars are often 
formed in proximity to other large stars and  
remain near them due to their strong gravity and 
short lives. As a result a neutron star is very  
likely to end up in a collision or death spiral 
with another neutron star or white dwarf, and the  
resulting collision can lead to a Kilonova, a very 
powerful and short-lived event partially fueled by  
all the heavy elements made in the collision. And 
this is good for us, because we believe roughly  
half the heavy elements in this universe - 
like gold, platinum, and uranium, come from  
these violent mergers. If you have a gold ring 
or watch or coin, that item was probably forged  
in the collision of two neutron stars and managed 
to escape that devastatin to help form our planet.
