Today is World Soil Day, and I think it is worth 
noting that there is no place we know of other  
than on Earth that actually has soil. Places like 
the Moon and Mars have what we call “Regolith”,  
which is basically crushed up rocks. There’s 
not much erosion on places like the Moon either  
so that rock is often very sharp particles that 
stick to everything and damage equipment badly,  
as the Apollo missions found.
But Soil or dirt is a mix of organics  
materials with minerals, gasses, liquids, and 
organisms, and to terraform new planets or farm  
inside giant rotating space habitats, we’re 
going to have to get good at taking supplies  
of frozen ices and regolith and transmuting into 
soil. And if we do find any alien soil out there,  
it isn’t likely to be something we would want to 
try to plant our crops in. It's easy to forget how  
important that dirt is, since it's everywhere 
under us, but it truly is the stuff of life.
