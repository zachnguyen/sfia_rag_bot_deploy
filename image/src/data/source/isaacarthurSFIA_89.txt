S044 Martian Solar Mirrors November 18, 2023
One problem for settling the Red Planet is
that it’s very cold, with Mars getting less
than half the sunlight we do.
This is enough for plants to grow, so we can
use insulated domes, as we looked at recently
in our episode the Domes of Mars, but to ever
have a chance to be an Earth-like planet with
open skies, we need more sunlight, and even
under domes it helps a lot.
By placing many lenses and magnets at the
Martian L1 point, we might add sunlight and
deflect solar wind, but that’s a big task,
and in the more near term, we may find it
easier to place large thin mirrors in orbit
of Mars.
These could use solar power to maneuver themselves,
and focus light down on bases below.
Since they are vastly thinner and lighter
than a Dome of the same area would be, they
represent a minimal expenditure compared to
any base they are shedding light on, and could
be constructed on one of the Martian Moons,
Phobos or Deimos, and help turn the Red Planet
Green.
