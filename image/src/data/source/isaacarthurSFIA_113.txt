S031 The Great Filter - Are We Doomed or Exceptional
September 26, 2023
The Fermi Paradox contemplates reasons why
in so an ancient and huge Universe we donâ€™t
see enormous alien civilizations everywhere,
and the Great Filters approach tries to think
of reasons why life, or intelligent life,
is rare.
However, there is great debate on whether
or not loud and enormous alien civilizations
are rare because nascent spacefaring civilizations
like are own are rare, or if they are common
enough but just tend to fail at space travel
or blow themselves up.
What we call late filters.
Is humanity the rare jewel of life and intelligence
in a barren galaxy, or have many come before
us, wondered the same thing, and either never
gotten off their planet or blown it up.
Are we fairly normal and doomed to destroy
ourselves before much longer or are we exceptional?
Is our galaxy littered in the ruins of a million
planetary graveyards, or a trillion lifeless
planets waiting for us to come and settle
them.
