good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window so our
moderators can start relaying those to
me as soon as we start please try to
keep the questions concise and watch
your spelling and try to be polite to
others in the chat it actually is we
usually go for about an hour so you
probably want to grab a drink and a
snack though we'll take a break about
halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
good afternoon and welcome to our
monthly livestream q a i'm your host
isaac arthur and this uh
typical end of the month sunday thing we
do here is we ask questions from the
audience uh those get relayed to my wife
sarah who will be reading them off to me
as we go and ezra doesn't realize she's
on camera at the moment
and we are joined today also by one of
our regular co-writers uh jerry gohan
and carmenettos who is in visiting
for the weekend and may read off some
questions as we go so we're gonna get to
your questions right from the get-go uh
about halfway through as usual we'll
take a break and just get your questions
in the moderators on the chat
and we'll ask them as we get a chance to
go through
well we had a question from mary
kwakowski and he says isaac we know that
changing matter into energy is possible
and changing energy into matter should
be
is it possible that k2 civilizations use
technology that changes energy into
matter making their dyson spheres to not
emit any energy could that type of dyson
sphere hide alien life from us and be
mistaken for black holes or dark matter
it's a good question apparently we had
the audio live in the studio while we
were doing the introductory song too um
so let's all remember not to talk during
the intermission um
so the question is basically
can a civilization take off its waste
heat energy all the excess light coming
out of its stall and turn it into matter
and i think is they are essentially
turning it back into matter because what
star does it takes
all that matter and turns it into energy
for you to use and more matter usually
higher ties to effusion um you might
decide you want to convert entire star
into matter but if you have the ability
to do that uh convert energy in the
matter you're probably able to turn
other types of matter pretty much
directly into other types of matter and
i suspect you wouldn't have quite as
much you know walk around is that a way
you could hide yourself through the
waste heat i doubt it because what
you're really saying there is that
you know yes you have the ability to put
energy in the matter but what you're
really seeing is you have the ability to
break lots of thermodynamics that you
can do without you gotta waste heat
whether or not you can tone energy into
matter and you can we do this already um
does not assume you can break the laws
of the dynamics during the process of
doing it so it's really just kind of um
an extra steps process there by saying
that you can turn it into matter so i'd
say probably not but you can rule it out
depends on what tech you have i guess
question from jacob would there ever be
a convergence of technological
capability in terms of launch costs per
weight and consumer demand to export
water in bulk from earth to mars o'neill
cylinders or etc
um probably not just because there's so
much water out there on this i mean
why is the most common molecule in the
solar system that's not hydrogen only or
helium only uh once you get out past the
asteroid belt the water is just all over
the place um
and the kuiper belt it has more water on
the north does many times over saturn's
moons and asteroid
ring have
tons of water
uh it's kind of a head cannon for in the
warhammer 40k so if uh sunday where
they've lost all their water on the
planet they say it got blown off by by
atomic bombs repeatedly my headcanon for
that particular one is that they
actually probably exported to the
o'neill cylinders right up in higher
orbit
and it is possible that it might be
cheaper at some point to bring water in
a couple hundred you know kilometers up
into overall space stations than to
bring in a couple hundred million
kilometers from the kuiper belt but i
don't really think you'd actually be
exporting water off or too much
you might though to make yourself have
additional land space you want lower
levels the ocean
okay and from josh maleski
if you increase the rotation rate of a
star enough will it deform into a torus
like how donut planets do or is there
something about solid material that can
do this while plasma cannot
um this is actually a question kind of
comes up in the context of doing this
with black holes too you say if we
spun a black hole or a group of neutron
stars that could form a black hole with
a combined mass without actually merging
uh what's called a curving could you
actually see the singularity of the
center of that or naked singularities
it's called without actually having the
event horizon around it and that one's
kind of iffy but yes you could actually
have uh in the case like maybe a neutron
star for instance a torus of super hot
gas i don't know
donut
i do not know how you would get a donut
of matter actually to form naturally
like that but you should actually do
that and indeed there are maybe some
like binary modules because a lot of
times those get very close and do
actually merge at some point uh you
might have a pair of binary stars that
did that somehow naturally but you
probably could make something like that
artificially
like a toy or something
welcome back merv johnson thank you for
your super chat and i think this has to
be his favorite running joke as a
crowd-funded evil ai
isaac can you please do an episode on
private spaceship ownership what are the
costs and capabilities of a real
millennium falcon
you know that would probably be a fun
one to do in some respects small
personal space shots but um
there are only so many well
actually yeah i think that's a good
episode we will we will probably do an
episode at some point because it caught
my attention so if i can remember to
um because i mean just in general one of
the few ways i've thought that you could
only do the spacecraft on earth that had
all that power but you trusted would we
do that uh approach photography doing
scramjets where you migrate beam the
energy to the thing so you can cut that
supply off it deviates off that
and there's just that energy consuming
all the time with spaceships that you're
basically giving someone a nuclear bomb
to ride around on so
that could be interesting it could be
they did that and doctor strangelove
though and i've always wanted to write a
nuclear bomb
ben mcelwain says do you care to comment
on the disappearing star's observations
um
i think we did an episode on
disappearing stars before we paradoxed
the screen stars episodes
we went to that in a lot more detail
they are i suggest that episode um we'll
see we think we also look at the cosmic
voids in that one too um just in general
disappearing stars come to many
different classifications of why they
disappeared it's our classification
before we had found this at some point
now it's not there some examples would
be a nova no one realized was a nova
dimmed out others would be it's occluded
by dust or we just confused with star
nearby the data wasn't too
spot on and now we think it's a whole
new stall because it changed brightness
a little bit so there's a lot of reasons
some of them might be because of aliens
or unknown phenomena
s.j mccowan says isaac we evolve fairly
near the equator so if we make planets
and space habitats have 24-hour days
which didn't before would we make them
have a 12-12 day night split all year
round
it depends on how you're lighting them
but i suspect like
if i'm building online cylinders and
what you think of as a dyson swarm i'm
building a couple trillion of them
um you know the whole idea is you got
billions of times the living area
available to you there that you have on
earth um
and each of those stations is not even a
thousandth the size of walking trips
land area more like a million so you got
trillions of them some of them are going
to be weather systems that do not
actually exist on earth some of them are
going to be you know ones that are very
extreme like the sahara desert one so
i'm gonna be the let's try to make the
you know um
see what you tiger one or recreate
dinosaurs and kind of thing but you're
mostly gonna have things that are well
figure out where people mostly choose to
live nowadays because they like the
climate and that's what they're probably
to replicate inside most of those um and
i would guess that just means that
you're going to have a lot of seasonal
variation though but probably not snow
or it snows from december 15th through
january 6 and it's done i like snow i
like snow too but we always like it in
reasonable quantities right so we don't
necessarily want a ton of snow all year
out or slush
um
if you want to go skiing you'll want
snow so you might need a spot i don't
want to go skiing yes but other people
might want to you might want to i want
to go skydiving in space
raven609 isaac could we breed or
engineer new meats and vegetables how
about things like honey and milk and
what is the future of food i've always
wanted to create the bacon tree a tree
that grows bacon live bacon
it sap would probably be blood and that
might qualify as an abomination but yeah
but who doesn't want a bacon tree you
know when they grow candy um they're all
i mean
allegedly there are like five flavors
core flavors that we have that we sense
um you can see there's like certain
ranges of frequencies there's obviously
a lot you can do with those five um
don't even change the possibility that
you might create a new nervous ending
for a sixth flavor or things like that
but um
i don't see any reason why you couldn't
make something like grew
entirely new flavors of food things like
that that's something you seem to be
within the realm of what we've done
pre-genetic engineering we can start
doing now we can actually start printing
dna really changes the game up a lot
dragon king says happy belated birthday
thoughts on the foundation series
i'm going to have to give you the
thoughts on the foundation novels
because i did not watch the first
episode yet on prime uh i gave that just
came out a couple days ago i am going to
catch that i'm leaving forward to it i
keep my fingers crossed it will be good
um i love the original series
uh it's
you know it's asthma my name for him um
i really can't uh imagine that the
show could really live up that level but
i'd like it to i always go into these
things hoping it's gonna be good i do
sometimes like the film's gonna be it's
like with dune which is my next favorite
series i liked the david lynch film i
actually defended on rios of justice a
lot last week
um and i liked the mini series they did
on sci-fi channel i still haven't seen
because that's come out yet the new dune
movie we keep your fingers crossed
that's going to be a good series but i
see it yet so
great book series hopefully good tv
series
kang says well you do a video on
exploring the universe as an energy
being
like what michio kaku envisions i have
no ide
i have no idea of what bishokaku
envisions it was actually means um
jay do you know anything on
um
i'm going to assume that that's
something kind of like the q or the
ascended means you know from star trek
or from star gate it would be awesome if
you could run around the galaxy or
universe um as a big old ball of energy
with vast amounts of power i don't
really see that one in the cards
except in a very trans humidity kind of
way it seems like i don't tend to think
those psychic powers but you can
certainly make a technological role in
telepathy if you want to so we'll have
to see but i i've not really given that
much thought personally
welcome back isaac bradeau have you ever
played kerbal space program
i've tried it out but i haven't gotten
too into it i know everybody there's
that's one of those ones like solos
that's incredibly popular with the
channel the audience but i not really
play it that much i hate to say most of
my video gaming time for sci-fi
goes into making episodes these days so
i am that's why i'm almost always behind
on catching up these things i think the
last sci-fi video game i really got into
was
mass effect and that probably tells you
about how far out of date i am on that
and i've not played andromeda so i was
done the series by then
divide by zero and get cake how's that
for a name that's a good name
hi isaac have you ever considered a
renewable energy episode
we've done i'm well
i wouldn't want to do an episode on
renewable energy in general though
that's maybe not a bad idea because we
could do like a summary of the various
looks but it usually
like there's at least eight or nine
different major types of renewable
energy we could look at
uh for given value renewable a lot of
times the show you know a billion years
does not qualify as a renewable energy
source to us um but uh
a lot of times i'd have like enough time
to maybe give you a two minute rundown
on those i don't know what i i try to do
episodes that amount to the first
paragraph of wikipedia entry on topic
because you know there's that wikipedia
entry already available to people um
i did want to do a dive on solar power
at some point because we did thorium we
did fission we've done fusion we've done
antimatter we've done power satellites
maybe we should instead of doing one on
hydro on on an actual regular solar on
geothermal and things like that but uh
the actual like summary episode maybe
maybe
salomon sulman says hi isaac are you
going to write a novel
um i will almost certainly some point
time write a book but probably either
beyond mega structures of the fermi
paradox
fiction's another story uh if you're
looking for good fiction i can recommend
one because we have an author present
we'll just switch back over to jerry
there hello
and i will try to remember after the
live stream is done be live to put a
link to his channel there uh jerry again
one of our regular writers on the show
he's got a channel uh jerry stories you
can find links for it on several
episodes but uh
he's written uh what no moon to pray to
his fans you know historical fantasy but
he's done a lot of sci-fi short stories
that are on audio only formats over on
his show on his channel i definitely
recommend checking them out some of them
are my favorites i've helped edit a few
of them too so
um but as to be ever doing fiction
i tend to
well also write like my namesake i'm
very big on exposition very low on plot
and characters that are not um
wooden exposition pieces so i like to
build words and i say like to give the
stories of people to be in them
which is a very lengthy way of saying
that brevity is not your strong suit he
says thank you
no one watching this live stream was
ever all the impression brevity was my
strong suit
well just in case they had any questions
sci-fi by alan crowley thank you for
your super chat he says i've been away
for a while and it's so good to be back
keep up the great work
superman also a live chat
super chat says i'm a long time fan and
i love your videos
tuman says isaac is there any task that
would end up being ubiquitous but also
require a sapient level intelligence how
would ai be able to protest on just
treatment from their overseers
well there's a lot to unpacking that one
um
the question is do we actually need a
repetitive task by ai that requires
human level intelligence that that seems
like the first half that was the second
question there
you just go away from it
how would ai be able to protest unjust
treatment from their overseers that was
the second question um honestly
protesting unjust treatment for your
overseas is historically not a useful
way to to get that a lot of times it
needs your overseers to suddenly get
ethics um
if we start creating ai and we don't
care about their rights because we don't
believe they have them then they'll
never get them probably never because we
can program them they're not starting
off with humans in this case you're
talking about
i want you to you are a professional
super intelligent garbage cleaner your
job is to eat garbage this is what
you've been made for and i've made you
to enjoy it hopefully i i could imagine
a particularly sadistic race that had
decided to build them to not enjoy it um
we have that example with the the
affront in the cultural series about e m
banks they were given the technology to
make um
any number of much more high-tech and
and humane approaches to things that
they actually decided to use genetic
engineering to make their things they
hunted more afraid and terrified by them
instead also
i think if you if you're a civilization
that has ethics you want to start
thinking about that whole ai issue
before you ever
ever actually have to come up with the
concern of whether or not any of them
are being unjustly treated um
but the thing is i don't think we're
gonna really need a lot of artificial
intelligence at the human level you need
ai to be small and human or you make it
as small as it needs to be to do a task
most immediately you know how small does
my toaster need to be how smart does my
car need to be and a human you know you
do not need a human level intelligence
to drive a call safer than any human
could do it right
um
you need ai for non-human roles so
for the most part human level ai
really should be very uncommon and you
just use a human instead i think because
there's not a shortage of us
following up on one of the previous
questions raven609 says you should take
a vacation to play video games
that is probably not a bad idea to do at
some point in time but i i know i i get
twitchy if i if i don't
get back to the show so
trailing ultima says do you believe
there is a genuine chance humanity as we
know it will ever live outside the solar
system without some unlikely extreme
life extension option i cannot see any
way it could happen
is this the question of people from our
current generation world or
says humanity as we know it
oh i guess the idea being you know it it
would take centuries before there was
any significant human presence outside
the solar system
um if we had like colonies because this
is the travel time to get that first one
founded even if we were to send out
today and we're not like they set out
for at least a century i think
um would there still be anything like
normal humanity left that time and i
would say yes because
i
i don't think we really all expect to
see a future in which trans humans ai
post humans etc are really trying to
wipe out or replace the culture you're
just adding to it it's not going to be
on either them and us kind of i think
it's going to be a whole bunch of
different options
and no one's probably going to be a
position to
have total control over that so more
likely than not you get that uh
everything continues to exist state of
play where regular humans will still be
around you still have you know the amish
equivalent of the 20th century humanity
round and they might settle you know
alpha centauri or absolutely
um
but i also really wouldn't rule out that
people alive right now i mean i don't
mean little kids even like people all
age i have no idea how old you are
obviously um i am yes
uh might live to be you know thousands
of years old i really do think we're
gonna see radical life extension in our
lifetimes it is the technology i really
hope to see invented in my lifetime too
so
psycho says that the first episode of
the foundation is really good
i hope that i can see what to be such
too as it's good to get someone say that
popsicle jonathan thank you for your
super chat he says hello isaac first off
your videos are wonderful you are one of
those few channels that i cherish on
this site my question is will you be
making a video on tech
tech
technocracy if you have not already
thank you
have we done a technocracy episode
i knew that's how you pronounced that i
just got stuck oh yeah there was a
website on types of future governments
said that big list of accuracies
made opposites and bureaucracies and cry
talkies and i thought there was one on
technocracy but it was a couple years
ago i don't that was probably
technological singularity or something
but um
if we haven't we probably will that that
could be a good one to do i always
hesitate to do ones on on like future
government variations but we did do an
episode of future governments and that
didn't cause a gigantic clay war and uh
usually anything touches too much on one
of those topics that we avoid on the
show
where it doesn't actually cause everyone
to
get pissed off at the episode or where i
don't feel go through feeling like we
lost all neutrality then i'm okay with
writing that topic but usually
particular types of government the
concern there is does it seem like an
endorsement or condemnation of that and
you know obviously everyone's got their
opinions on these things myself included
but i don't want to see us endorsing one
of those topics we'll say on the show
paul ron thank you for your super chat
and he wants to know if you have any
thoughts on the recent uap
stuff
we
well
honestly there's not really anything all
that new there in my opinion i mean it's
not going to surprise anyone that i i we
did that one on ufos the navy ufos last
year i think
um i don't really think that they added
that much new to it um that's the
conversation on that one is still the
same when it was 10 or 15 years ago um
you either look at that as evidence of
alien life or you look at that as
evidence of something that isn't
properly accounted for yet and might be
mundane or might not be and uh i don't
think that we had anything to do with
this that's change that dynamic
and today's trivia question is from sano
bello they want to know what is the
biggest misconception you think that
they have about you
um
that i'm an artificially generated ai
that's accurate i'm a time traveling
alien
from the far distant past
misconception about me that people would
have uh i'm british i i know yeah i mean
that is one of my big old genealogy
bloodline backgrounds but uh i'm not
british i i was born in california and
raised in ohio
finlandery says what types of magic
could there be in a post-collapse
society what types of magic
yes m-a-g-i-c magic um wow
um
i mean well let's take an obvious
example um gene wolf's um
book of the new son
this is the one that begins with the
shadow of the torture uh the novel
that's set basically
everything in there
it seems fancy but as you go through it
you realize he's got nothing but an old
post-technological civilization lying
around the dust the miners are people
who are basically grave robbers the
mountains he's walking over all
collapsed arcologies and giant statues
every mountain is carved up in some
fashion
um and of course them i think they'll
seem like magic and the context that we
need to remember
people who believed in you know magic
back hundreds of years ago uh they
thought it worked that's that's why they
took it really seriously to them it was
no real different than what abortion
science they had folks like kepler and
newton they were mystics right we think
of them as the fathers of science and
that's fair enough in some ways but they
wouldn't make it through the first
introductory level of what we think of
as modern proper rational thought on
these topics um and uh you know kepler
in particular right
um
but at the same time what kind of magic
things that could like fake magic
because you think of it as a fancy
nanotechnology obviously even allowed
decent manipulation
of the environment with energy uh that
could be like microwave beams
sonic tweezers
just very tiny robots that you couldn't
see that did your bidding um you could
have things like technological telepathy
you could easily have every person on
some post-technological planet that
abandoned technology could so wired into
them you know that they was in their dna
it's like machines that just live inside
them that grew on them just like all the
other random parasites and symbiotes
that come with us with time and they had
abandoned all their technology because
they just didn't need it it was too
built into the environment and they
forgot that that's what that actually
was
um so that could happen but i don't
really think that's very likely to ever
happen it makes a great background story
for things but uh it's very popular on
sci-fi my usual suggested folks who are
writing by the way though is don't try
to make your fantasy system built on
something scientific just try to make
sure the wheels are consistent
chad thank you for your super chat he
says without life extension the human
population will likely stabilize at 9
billion do we still have a driver to
build state space habitat
i don't believe that for one second
the idea that the population is going to
stabilize at 9 billion mind you it's
going to be 8 billion another year or so
right
is not the best my knowledge backed up
by any peer-reviewed scientific anything
ever
yeah there's i i throw this thing passed
around when i was a kid it was 16
billion and that would be by this year
and we all be dead people do population
predictions like this all the time
they're always wrong
and they are never based on anything
other than analyzing a cough like you
would just do in you know a high school
eligible class
um
what we know about people is they tend
to have children if they can comfortably
do so when you think the civilization
probably cannot completely do so you
tend to discourage people from having
kids so we might stabilize i would hope
we'd stabilize
at under 20 billion before we actually
had a big space presence because trying
to do much more than that without
abundant power supply would be very hard
however we should not assume that people
are going to just stop at some magic
number of 9 or something like that and i
do not trust any of the extrapolations
to say that right i hear the numbers
kicked around and they change every
decade and they're always a little bit
different and they don't seem to be
based on any sort of actual science
so there is that on that the other
aspect of course is if you got 9 billion
people what's stopping from going to
space the idea is it stabilized because
people are saying we're having too many
kits for the environment we're having
that's baked into the culturals that are
currently having population declines or
growth rate declines they've been saying
for decades or generations um we have
too many people we're going to have
these malthusian you know dystopian
hellhole what's going on if we keep
having kids
that factors into how the society looks
at having kids if all of a sudden you
can start going up into space and having
as many kids you want to know neo
cylinder then that does shift the
attitudes on this a lot too so there are
a ton of different factors going on how
much people are going to have for kids
but and whether or not it has any new
space travel i don't know but getting
into space
the space race was done between a
country that had at the time 150 million
people in the united states and i think
about 180 in the entire soviet union in
the 60s
so i i don't think that you need to
worry about the population total and 9
billion for instance preventing you from
deciding you want to go into space
floor horbeck says how do you make these
videos are they computer generated or do
you draw everything yourself and if so
which program do you use 3d studio max
ghana um i do not
draw everything myself
like the live stream for instance is
definitely not animated it's it's
terribly big straight on your vest to
animate a live show
we use a lot of stock animations we use
a lot that made by the animators that
volunteer on the show
most of it is stock footage uh that we
get from various locations i did do some
animations early on for the show myself
i still make a lot of the single graphic
explanations where it's just like one
image that pans around those are usually
me
but i don't really
we're doing 30 minutes a video a week
plus an extra episode every month that
is not time to create animations for
every single thing even pixar would have
problems keep up something like that so
joe says hi isaac you've talked about
how the romans missed heron's engine
before what potential technologies that
could revolutionize our world are
potentially hidden in plain sight is
this a idea for a future episode thanks
low-tech civilizations um
that was an episode yeah there were the
low-tech space marine episodes yeah um
i guess
the problem of course is i can't really
tell you what technologies are hidden in
plain sight because if i knew what they
were and they were easy i'd just go
patent them
um
there is a mock tendency to find out
that a lot of the technologies we have
uh
you know we look at some kind of
progressive steps on each one and
there's a certain truth that you know
you're not gonna invent really good
computing unless you've got
semiconductors or something
very parallel like um
i guess you could probably do it with
with very tiny
graphene powders for instance a
mechanical computer
but there while there is some things
that are built on top of love a lot of
times the technology is just that
somebody fired on thinking about it and
of course that's part of the on the
environment you don't invent the paper
clip until paper is very cheap you know
until paper was everywhere the paper
clip probably does not get invented um
but there's nothing complex about that
so there are going to be tons of those
expect the vast majority of innovation
to consider to be something that people
just didn't think of
until now they did
i'm gonna try to squeeze in two more
questions here before the break
we have a super chat from tom depco
thank you tom and he wants to know what
your thoughts are on the hyperion series
of books it has some interesting
concepts but he's not heard you
reference it in any videos
i'm sure that we have actually mentioned
dan simmons hyperion series is one i'm
thinking you probably think you haven't
i i was very fond of the first first
book or pair of books um i i don't
really remember the third and fourth
book as well but uh they're very good if
you haven't read them they they take the
narrative standpoint of telling if it's
a group of people each telling their
previous story why they visit the planet
before they go back as a group to visit
again
um and it's uh i mean it is it's a
classical science fiction for a reason
i'm very fond of it but kind of physics
involved in it so
quasi-hard the the arthur clearly dances
quickly tried to to make them pretty
solidly based as opposed to totally
space opera but uh there are some
interesting aspects of it
that i definitely recommend to folks
it's a good series to read
all right
oh it moved on me
okay
last question before the break is from
valdorg what about a series of videos
taking an optimistic outlook on the
topics of previous videos such as
sentient ai being treated more as a
children or legacy of humanity rather
than feared
i don't mind doing that um i mean the
thing is i usually think of the videos
already kind of on the optimistic side
so i don't know that we
uh
well yeah we could do something like
that look at humanity the upsides of ai
the positive side of
of skynet
it's interesting idea for an episode and
so if i can remember them through the
end of the live stream we'll see if we
maybe get around to doing that one hey
we're gonna go on to a break for a few
minutes it's a great chance of getting a
question to the mods or grab a drink in
a stack we'll see you in about four
minutes
so we'll be on break for a few minutes
and it's a great time to get in a drink
and a snack as well as more questions
for our second half we never have a
chance to get to them all though and so
if we can't get to yours you can leave
it in the comments of the episode i try
to get to most and other folks often
will answer too
speaking of questions we missed in the
live stream one from last month was why
a small black hole emits more radiation
than a big one that tends to confuse a
lot of folks we would just assume that
bigger black hole would admit more but
it's critical to the notion of hawking
radiation that the more massive a black
hole is the slower it leaks mass and
energy this results in black hole
lifetimes that make even the smallest
naturally fourier ones look at the whole
age of the universe as little more than
an eye blink and means that as they slim
down they eventually get powerful enough
to run starship engines or power plants
and for time periods and rates of
efficiency beyond even what fusion power
permits
but why is this so
there's a few ways to look at it without
deep math dives none of which are
terribly intuitive or accurate either
but the easiest is with virtual
particles
we tell folks that on the event horizon
of a black hole there's a pair of
virtual particles appearing and
disappearing constantly and that
sometimes one half that pair is just
close enough to fall in while the other
half is just far enough away to fly off
instead resulting that orphan virtual
particle becoming real and deducting
some mass from the black hole this is
all well and good but folks wonder why
it doesn't happen more often with bigger
black holes indeed this seems even worse
when we explain that it's not that
identifies the black holes causing
virtual particle bears they don't those
are constantly occurring everywhere even
inside you particles popping in and out
of existence and this is the quantum
foam you've heard of so you think a
bigger black hole with a bigger event
horizon would encounter a lot more of
these particle pairs
and they do
but now we get to the critical part the
further you are from any massive body
being a black hole or a planet or a tiny
asteroid the lower the gravity exerts on
you and this means even when standing on
earth your feet have more gravity yankee
on them than your head it's tiny but
measurable the thing is that the earth's
mass is big but quite spread out and
does not get any stronger as we get
closer to its center because we still
have a mass above us pulling us toward
it instead however if we compacted earth
down more to say a tenth of its current
diameter you would find yourself
standing on its surface experiencing 100
times normal gravity if you tried to
hang by your hands for a ball like doing
a pull up you'd rip your arms off
but even a little bit higher there is
noticeably lower gravity so something
tall enough to feel nurse below a
gravity on its top then bottom can get
shredded by that this is the
spaghettification we discussed in terms
of black holes
it has to do with the strength of
gravity rising sharply over a small
distance and that is more pronounced the
more compact the object or the smaller
the black hole indeed if you fell into
one of those big galactic center black
holes many galaxies have you wouldn't be
shredded before you reach the event
horizon because the tidal force is just
small there now turning this back to
hawking radiation the tidal force is
much stronger right above the event
horizon of a small black hole than a big
one meaning two particles very near each
other but one just a hail closer to that
black hole are experiencing vastly
different gravity pores
as a result the odds of one being ripped
down away from the other are vastly
higher enough to offset the vastly
bigger event horizon of more massive
black holes which produce basically only
the tiniest amount of hockey radiation
more than u or i or an empty flat bit of
space does and that's why hockey
radiation is bleed to rise as mass
decreases
i hope that answers your question now
let's get back to more of your questions
in part two of the live stream
i think we're waiting for a moment for
us to get back in the room because they
lost track of time so just flew through
some of the uh super chat questions
while we're waiting for them to get back
um got one from
council ball
has asked for thank you for the super
chat given that we have a proof of
concept for multi-cellular prokaryotic
life cyanobacteria i believe can we
expect an episode on prokaryotic aliens
um that's actually probably a pretty
good question overall is if whether or
not you mean
can we have a sentient one
that would be um
uh
let me just shut the door so the sound's
not coming through
but sorry
um
would we are we talking about having
like a colony organism like
a fungi that was sentient or we were
talking about more just whether or not
we expected a lot of prokaryotic life on
other planets but that might be an
interesting one to try i don't know that
there would really be a difference in
their behavior though like would
prokaryotic aliens that were sentient or
sapient really be any different than
ones that were
your chaotic um in terms of behavior so
kind of the same reason why wouldn't i
say anything ai would be all right let's
get back to the questions
that must have been the fastest four
minutes ever
um
did we ask this question already do you
think planet nine is real
no i don't think we did um i believe
that planet nine is absolutely real i'm
just not sure which particular planet
that would be at the moment um
you know before
before we discovered neptune uh right
after we discovered uranus we also had
named series vesta palace and one of the
ones you know i think planets they were
just calling them planets which is
effectively what they were at the time
we're still getting a better idea for
the size of these things because we kept
fighting all these giant planets and all
the gas giants
uh we decide well maybe these shouldn't
be planets especially because we've got
all these other asteroids we're finding
we didn't call them asteroids yet um and
so for a while the ninth planet would
have been let's see
um
jupiter jupiter was the ninth planet for
a little bit they can't have any other
ones uh pluto could still be considered
the ninth planet if you wanted is there
another big planet out there um i don't
think we're gonna find one that we think
was really being part of the source at
this point in time there was a huge
chunk of space um between us and they
are stars that really does not play part
of the solar system you can think of it
as an all hail sphere that area that we
kind of gravitationally control to some
degree but even thinking about what
cloud as part of the solar system is
really inaccurate because like you know
stellar medium that
is beyond the bit that our solar system
specifically carved out
so there really
isn't a lot of room for a planet that we
think of as a planet of our solar at
this point it's gonna have like an
orbital period of tens of thousands of
years an absolute minimum at this point
so
thank you for your second super chat
popsicle jonathan and he wants to know
this time do you think that tech
singularity will happen in the 2040s
like ray kirks predicts or is it
probably still a bit further away and
thank you again
i don't remember what he originally said
it was going to be too this is one of
those ones like
and it's not a shot at me
he
is probably one of our most accurate
futurists and i used to joke that if i
got a business card and i put futurist
or seer on there i'd say i'm right 51 of
the time uh honestly that that's
probably on the generous side for most
of us trying to predict the future even
getting to 51 would be you know just
better than randomly pretty good um he's
done a lot of very accurate predictions
but i think he's i think he and a lot of
those just off on the technological
singular thing they say a thing about
like one avenger um brilliant thinkers
uh but i think that everyone just
extrapolated moore's law a little bit
too far you know i think to keep in mind
is we may have
semiconductors and transistors computer
chips that are much smaller than a human
brain and much more compact than a
neuron but there's still weight they
gobble heat up compared to what a human
brain does our best supercomputers right
now are actually passing more than we
think a human brain would process
uh rate rise barely but they take up a
building and they produce uh they use
like a bigger water power to run versus
the 10 watts of brain users so um this
constant either going to keep shrinking
i think that's true but that's going to
snowball into some kind of very fast
technological singularity as opposed to
this you know gradual increase that
takes many generations that i've never
really agreed to and i think that that's
based off a little bit to me some uh
assumptions with that that technological
singularity episode way back in season
two
maybe we should do that one
chr smith thank you for your super chat
he says how do you view the idea that
hegelian dialectic of history there's a
thesis then an antithesis and then a
synthesis to become the thesis and
repeat
that but again
how do you view the idea of the hegelian
dialectic of history
which is
a thesis then an antithesis then a
synthesis and then it becomes a thesis
and you repeat
i know i'm gonna have to punt on that
question i i'm just not i'm not
swallowing i'm not getting that one
today maybe jerry did you get that one i
have no idea what that is
sarah
if you want to put in a rephrase uh the
moderators will keep an eye out for that
question again if you can make that one
a little bit clearer also
floor horbecki why do physicists believe
a black hole has a singularity why can't
it be a quark gluon plasma because of
the enormous heat and enormous pressure
which is the recipe for quark gluon
plasma
it could be
um
i think to keep in mind is we're making
assumptions around this and and and
singularity and mathematics i think we
could talk about when the episodes come
out pretty soon
specifically what singularity in
mathematics is an area that is poorly
defined or cannot be defined
mathematically right so as an example if
i'm walking around on the surface of a
cube all the corners are singularities
right
um they're not properly defined in terms
of
being on the surface of one of those
uh all that's a bit simplified um
we know that matter is keeping itself
apart based on a mixture of poly
exclusion principle and strong weak
nuclear forces and electromagnetic
forces
once those get shrunk down crunch down
you get degenerate matter as we call it
that's the white dwarf stage one then
you get the neutron star even more
compact then there's the possibly a
corkstar even more compact cork glue on
plasma and a plank stall which would be
something that's smashed all the way
down to potentially the strings level
things like that um
it may not be possible for somebody
actually be point-like all we know
though is there's nothing that we know
of currently that would stop it
from going all the way down to being a
point like dot
kind of the same for like the big bang
we don't know the reason why it wouldn't
have gone all the way down this guys but
there's nothing saying that definitely
did either
nathan griffith says will ai in the
future make visual artists redundant
no
uh if there's a market for visual arts
um there will be a market for visual art
made by humans there'll be a market for
visual made by ai um
there was the notion that television
would get well you know video kill the
radio star but it didn't right video is
still huge um
it's going to get rid of books the
internet will get rid of paper medium we
use more paper now and all people in
society than ever before um you know
things do go away there's no milk man
anymore but now we get the oconomowoc of
that with things being dropped off
you know um
i don't think we should assume that
that's definitely going to be the way
that happens i just completely forgot
what the question was wow
you answered it did i all right cool
moving on
trail ultima does humanity need a goal
right now we are advancing and exploring
but once we have pushed the limits of
what is physically possible to invent
and explore do we still have a purpose
sure um you first have to say what is
alcorn purpose um
and there are a lot of answers to that i
decided to say like well it's necessary
up for debate um
many people believe that we have a
specific purpose or purposes and i don't
know that anyone says that our main
purpose is to explore
the universe that's potentially one of
them but uh whatever it is you currently
think your purpose is for doing i don't
see how that would be
changed by
exploring the universe with detail and
running out things to explore we've
explored this planet i mean there's
there are yes lots of things that you
want to see with uh john crystal jacob
that you go see bits in the you know
mario's trends we've been found yet yes
there are underground lakes in
antarctica and other wonders we still
haven't found yet but the planet is
pretty much explored right and they will
get to a point where the planet is fully
explored at that point in time i don't
believe humans on earth have lost any
purpose for existing or that only
meaning proper speed explore the solar
system galaxy
stove pipe down tube says
when the robots start destroying
humanity what will be our best strategy
for survival
prayer uh
if the robot's in a position to to smash
us up
uh and can get away with doing it then
you have to appeal to somebody else
that's got a lot of power and if they
have even got other robots to ask to
help out or you've got some of the
faction like you know trans humans or
you know cyborgs or genetically ngo
superman or whatever it happens to be
appeal to a high or power to help you
out a case like that because that's
probably about your best shot safe like
alien invasions um you need to have
somebody you know
if somebody can kick your butt right now
because they're smiling you that is
probably going to only get worse with
time
so
um if we have robots running around they
can kick our butt they are not going to
likely get less good at it
patriot of the west thank you for your
super chat he says any personal
recommendations on good retro futurist
sci-fi
almost everything from the golden age is
still great um you know all your all
your google classics uh obviously isaac
asthma would be a good one um heinlein
uh frank cardboard that's a little bit
more new that's almost uh new wave uh
rogers eliza is a favorite from that era
um a lot of accounts the classics uh
campbell um
i can't know who wrote lensman uh doc
smith but uh even all the way back to
like the john carter on mars ones they
all have to be taken with a little bit
of a grain of salt you know scientific
accuracy and cultural changes but uh
those yeah if it's a it was a classic
20 years ago it's still classic now
robert thompson we still know relatively
little about our ice giants and their
moons
do you think we will see a mission to
those systems in our lifetime or will
the focus solely be on the moon mars
bases or asteroid mining
you know what's neat about having a big
presence in space uh like a moon basin
actually extract meadows and build you
know a big ship to go to balls is it
makes it a lot easier to fabricate a you
know one ton robot probe to go send it
uranus um
and uh neptune um and you can also start
doing those ion driving there much
faster or mass driver etc so yeah we'll
get folks out there again expect to
start seeing we can do them smaller too
expect to start seeing
wads of probes being sent out all over
the place in the next
you know 10 20 years after we actually
have our moon base
albert jackson hey welcome back it's
been a little while hey isaac what uses
would arise from wiring every or almost
every neuron in the brain with
electrodes assuming it's possible
practical or useful or similar mind
augmentation technologies
if you do it to everyone on the brain
the presumed purpose would be to
probably copy that mind uh
as a
well basically to copy that mind on the
computer uh order
completely i mean you don't need that
much to be able to read a person's brain
or control a person's brain so that's
probably not your objective there um but
uh like
well we talked about mind augmentation
uh even three thousand little switches
like you got that knowledge chipped in
that might also say do you have a mohawk
mouse that i always like to show you
yeah like what do you think is gross i
think yeah
there's this picture of a mouse got the
little thumb drive so you know the back
of its head that looks like the house
well
it's kind of mohawk it was awesome yeah
poor house
or like the ape that did the banana
smoothie pong game um
you know if you got a few buttons you
had a few hundred buttons in your head
they could be used as like your hotkeys
for anything you want that really speeds
up your ability to do a lot of
interactions about local machinery and
that those are all programmable you can
set the most they're not gonna be things
you're accidentally flipping at
nighttime um that's the big advantage
that is it's just going to
massively boost our interactivity with
all the stuff around us that's digital
okay so
switching from digital to wood
cr smith wants to know if he can make a
spaceship primarily out of wood
we were just talking about weird things
you could do with wood yesterday during
our brainstorm um
we used to do brainstorms for the
episodes uh like every couple of weeks
just kind of look at topics we were
getting ready to write and see what
happened with them and we hadn't done
one about a year or so uh covert and
everything else crazy going on and we
just got having our first one again last
night
and one of these that came up was we're
doing the topic of upcoming advances in
material science that's going to be out
sometime in december i think
and uh one that was just as a sub topic
for that episode was
what cool new things to be done with
wood is you know like
materials well very mundane to us
concrete et cetera what new stuff to be
done with them to answer the question
could you build something out of wood i
don't think you could build a spaceship
out of wood but it does have some
properties that wouldn't be bad for like
radiation resistance but it does remind
me of an episode that comes to mind
jerry remember our spacebar's episode
and um
we uh we wrote the void ecology and
space whales episode
and i i think the other one who saw me
on the void ecology episode weren't you
yeah my favorite yeah that was a great
one to write together and one of these
we talked about the space wells episode
that was kind of the companion episode
for that was
could you basically grow um spaceships
like they were coral you know coral
reefs ones um
so they basically was a grown organism
with a protective shell of you know moon
rock around it things like that and uh
maybe that would be something like a
a tree or a space tree forest trees
things like that the dyson tree was a
notion of a growing space habitat that
was basically a tree but a little less
organic so
we should have done an episode on that
either so yes it would be an interesting
topic to do possibly i'm noticing a
theme in today's live stream you're
getting like the next six months worth
of episodes
well we got the next four months already
planned out anyway all right well after
that i mean sounds like a lot of good
ideas
if i can remember them
david says any good sci-fi universes set
100 to 200 years from now that are not
about how good the future is but
that are about a more normal life or the
bad things governments and corporations
do
the entire cyberpunk genre is about the
bad things governments and corporations
there that's pretty much the cyberpunk
genre uh plus tattoos and uh
like uh asian fusion oh that's pretty
much
um
uh solar punk is supposed to be a little
bit more optimistic on that that sign
but i haven't really seen too much of it
other than that yogurt commercial um
which i
still was surprised but shabbat used
yogurt
was very weird um so we posted to our
facebook forum and it was the surprising
it's also quite a lot of
topic discussion
um
there is a lot of uh bleak borderline
grim dark uh you know century two from
that stuff that's
been popular forever a day if you're
looking for examples that
uh the entire judge dread and everything
associated that series is a good one for
that uh anything cyberpunk anything by
neil stevenson that isn't set in the
past
um
uh
i could give you so many examples
um
there's a lot less optimistic stuff
about the future in science fiction
there is pessimistic stuff and part of
that is because
optimistic science fiction
tends to make for a little bit of a
boring story everything's awesome and
everybody has like all they need and
there's no major wars going on
just doesn't make for a very good plot
you know but if you do want a more
optimistic future then eat your yogurt
so you have strong probiotics for a
happy future
father brush your body
that's where your camera cause i could
so when my wife's not trying to get me
to choke to death on a glass of water
but that was not intentional
wow oh hey the person's name is wow
how accurate do you think the expanse
show is in terms of how humanity will be
in 200 to 300 years
uh it's better than a lot of other ones
they the authors usually do keep
their signs a little bit harder on that
obviously with the exception what to do
with the proto molecule um
but uh
i know the
the the well the books vary from the tv
show for one thing i should point out i
haven't actually read any of the books
past where the tv show was at for season
four i haven't finished watching season
five yet so i don't know about the later
books per se and i know they just had a
new one come out not that long ago um
but
it's one of those one shows
earth's got 30 million people on it most
guys are like a billion or something and
they have roughly equal power for some
reason and there's the asteroid belt
where for some reason they don't have
water or air
in spite of that they have gigantic
fusion engines that can take you from
one side of the solar system the other
at like full bone the entire time
nothing about that is right that that's
it's great story i love the expanse but
if you have powerful space engines that
can carry people around
for
uh less than it costs to pay them for an
entire year right if your passage to
another planet isn't costing you a
million bucks of the equivalent money
nowadays then you do not have
shortages of water you do not have um
shortages of air you don't have 30
billion people on the planet
who have nothing to do with their spare
time or any food because that's just not
how a fusion economy works you got cheap
fusion like that
dustin king says could you make a ring
world using active support or is there
some other technology that would make it
strong enough um it trying to do a
full-on ring world is really dubious
with active sport but i think we did
talk about this in the ringwood episode
um
maybe i had to check back that was quite
a while ago uh what what the suggested
path is they're probably better ones but
this one that came to mind for me on
this one because i was like active
support i love orbital rings and
basically use that technology for that
purpose what you do and you probably do
something a little bit more modest like
a bank's orbital which is a better omega
structure anyway you build a big
ring that doesn't spin or spins very
slowly or even spins counter clockwise
or something great um counter routines
are the main one big heavy ring and in
that you put basically a magnetic
cushion and you spin the smaller
habitation ring inside that and it
pushes magnetically against the bottom
of that bigger heavier ring and that's
how you get your tensile strength to
hold that thing together you're
basically just distributing the load to
that much heavier
non-rotating structure
um i don't know that you'd actually do
that but if you want to build something
like a bank soldier with
existing node science materials that's
pretty much how you have to do it a much
bigger ring in which that thing rested
and you might just fill it with
something like hydrogen gas or you know
whatever use of stuff you have you can't
find another use for
we were talking about creepy halloween
things before we got into this episode
and i think this person may have
overheard us they said the deadly glitch
hey isaac how big and destructive can a
weapon get and still be practical would
a universe destroying bomb make sense as
using it would destroy everything in
existence
um
well most of the most of the scientific
pathways i said we don't actually have
any science for how to destroy the
universe right most of the scientific
pathways under basic theories that would
let you destroy the universe
all set in the context of their being
more outside of that universe like uh
causing a drop to um
you know the the uh oh god god what's
that called
the the the
false vacuum right we don't actually
exist in a pure vacuum if you dropped us
to true vacuum uh that would destroy the
universe but the assumption a lot of
those is there's multiverses there are
brains out there for instance from
string theory or m theory um
i would be surprised there was even
actually allowed you to destroy all of
reality period by interest thanos i
don't know um
or actually i think was the beyonders
that were blowing up
whole universes and marvel comics
doesn't matter um
you could potentially have something
that the size of a pinhead before we
know if if it's one of those things
where you basically just have to poke a
hole in reality in one place and a
lesser or just fall apart then that
could be very small you have to keep in
mind though i just want to know in
science a gun that fired bullets with
antimatter inside them will let you walk
around something like an m16 with which
you could stand up on a mountain with
one clip of ammo and blow away the
entire eastern seaboard with one clip
and at that speed
and that's under known signs that's
that's just that's how destructive that
is right
uh you might need to reload a couple
times you really want to atomize
everything as opposed to just you know
kill most people in those cities you can
make some very potent tiny weapons that
would kick superman's butt you know
sci-fi fighters have no sense of scale
usually so it doesn't come up much
so grant self says do you believe that
humanity will reach a point of clean
energy efficiency that we could
eventually reverse the adverse effects
we have had on the planet and when do
you think that will be i think it'd be
kind of a continuing process because
you're going to have other ones that pop
up too
um
you know it i don't like when people say
that we you know if every problem this
technology solves two new ones pop up
it's not a hydra you know they we get
new and better approaches i know it's
good salad with strange people because
we have so much more technology now that
we can do so much more damage but we
actually are much better
at stewardship of the planet the
environment than than our ancestors were
they are actually mostly horrible at it
they just couldn't do that much damage
because they mostly wanted a position to
do it right and of course that depends
on when we're looking timeline-wise and
which cultural and civilization but um
the ability to repair damage we do
has always got to be a focus of any real
effort to do terraform in the future too
right if we want to have a future we
have to not wreck the planet and you're
not going to be able to take the
population move to another planet that
we terraform because the only way you
can tear form plants is with the science
and resources to fix your own right so
there's no abandoning this world to go
to mars that's not in the cards
right
um
as to whether or not we'll get it oh i
think they are i think so we mostly want
to so
it's it's a process it's slow it's
irritating it's not as fast as most
response the ways we want it but we are
making progress on i think
stovepipe downtube says do you think
robots and aliens are going to save the
human race by teaching us all to be good
little atheist socialists
i'm surprised that one got through the
moderators sorry that was the question
would you
do you think robots and aliens are going
to save the human race
by teaching us all to be good little
atheist socialists probably not but i am
surprised that one got through the
moderators that that is a one of those
basically political and religious
questions everyone's got their own
personal views on so i'm not touching
that with a 10-foot bowl
well
before we let everybody go i think we
have just one more minute left did you
want to uh
probably get a different question
final uh
wrap on
our guest
jerry
let's focus over him and and cindy can
you find us one more question before we
finish out after that too tell us about
your channel oh wait he's gotta have the
microphone oh oh
here you are okay yeah my uh channel is
uh jerry's stories which uh actually
isaac encouraged me to uh start a couple
of years ago um
and it's uh my science fiction and
fantasy stories and uh um it was uh this
guy here who uh pushed me to start uh
recording them and uh posting them on
youtube so uh check that out sometime
and i think we got another question up
yes so the last question of the day is
going to be
from cr smith thank you for your super
chat he says sorry for my last question
i i don't think that was the previous
one that was further up
the q
from the book all tomorrows are an
intergalactic nomadic species
they change species using genetic
engineering to warped forms furniture
pets etc is this possible um i've not
actually read that um that particular
book but it does remind me of the uh
the one metamorphosizing creatures from
douglas adams restaurant into the galaxy
they mutated so fast and one of them uh
turned itself into a couch
and then into the atmo of their fleet in
like five seconds very strange examples
i love douglas adams um but uh
i don't know you could actually have a
way that obviously would not be a
species at that point in time because
they're changing the genetic structure
too much but you could have a
civilization that basically just uh
instead of tearful implants bioform to
them they basically just change
themselves to change themselves around
whatever will work on that planet that
environment that setting and i think as
we say
usually we expect everything to be a mix
of bioforming and tail for me you know
we have a civilization go live up
for the north they
you know they bio-form a bit by
going ahead and putting on heavier
clothing and they're making little
adaptations a little bit on that
environment but they also terraform bed
by building houses or environments get a
little less smell
so
that's probably a good place to close
out for the day
before you head out we want to
give a shout out to abraxas c and thank
him for his super chat and good luck in
writing your book
and so we'll go ahead and close out
