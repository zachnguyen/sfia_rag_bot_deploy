Nuking Venus. Venus is often considered a far 
superior candidate for terraforming than Mars,  
as its gravity is already very close to that 
of Earth. As we discussed in Winter on Venus,  
Venus’s temperature and day length can 
be adjusted downward by clever use of  
orbital solar shades far more easily than 
Mars can be given more gravity, and Mars  
would still require solar mirrors to heat it.
The problem is that Venus still has far more  
carbon dioxide than we want, 200,000 times what 
is in our own atmosphere. Venus’s atmosphere is  
100 times more massive than our own, and is almost 
all carbon dioxide, not a small percent like here.  
Cooling the planet might leave lakes or glaciers 
of Carbon Dioxide behind, but an alternative is  
to either direct a powerful solar beam at Venus 
to boil the atmosphere off or nuke it repeatedly  
to blow most of it off. This would be effective 
but many other options we discussed in Winter on  
Venus and Colonizing Venus are available 
too, that might be preferable to that option.
