We often dream of a future out in the 
galaxy, exploring and settling strange new  
worlds under the light of alien suns, but 
what would living in space truly be like? 
Last week we were talking about Near-Term Space 
Colonization and some of the hurdles we would  
encounter on our journey to settle new worlds, 
but we didn’t talk much about what living in space  
itself would actually be like and what the 
challenges for humans are when living off Earth. 
It’s a big topic because space is big; really 
big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely,  
mind-bogglingly big it is. And that also means 
there are a lot of different conditions humans  
will need to adapt to in order to live in those 
places, or adapt them to our needs, or possibly  
meet somewhere in the middle, as we often have 
in our history on just this single world, and its  
many different climates & ecosystems, which again 
is but one world among billions and billions. 
Now, we’re not talking today about living in 
the actual void of space, which is empty of  
everything life needs and plentiful in harsh 
radiation and high-speed micro meteors. We  
contemplated biology adjusted to the vacuum in our 
episode Void Ecology, but today we’re principally  
interested in how life can be adapted to space 
settlements we build, or those settlements we  
build on planets, moons, comets, or asteroids.
While the title of today’s episode needs little  
explanation, it comes from the title of both a 
book and an annual presentation track which the  
National Space Society runs at the International 
Space Development Conference. That track is one  
of several that go on at the same time at the 
ISDC each year and Living in Space is run by my  
friend Dr. Sherry Bell, the Dean of Psychology 
at the Kepler Space Institute. More than one  
episode on this channel has been inspired 
by those presentations, including Staying  
Sane in Space from last year, which discussed the 
hundred-and-one ways space can drive you nuts in  
just a few weeks on board the space station.
Our goal is not to repeat that information,  
since the book[a] and many other presentations 
cover those topics very well, but rather to look  
further ahead. To try to imagine what the future 
would be like if you were an asteroid prospector,  
for instance, patrolling deep space in a small 
ship hoping to find and claim a small rock as  
your own and mine it. Probably all the easy finds 
are already mined or claimed, and this means your  
life in the future is strikingly like life was for 
your ancestors in the distant past – where a great  
deal of time was spent searching for and gathering 
resources. Or an asteroid miner who might be  
essentially living in their space suit all day, or 
even all night[b][c][d], augmented by its powered  
exoskeleton and advanced electronics. By the time 
people start wearing space suits for an everyday  
job, we'd expect it to be more comfortable now, 
maybe even like overalls or even a second skin. 
Perhaps you’re the bartender at the pub[e][f] 
on the station where miners bring back their  
ore so it can be refined and fired by giant 
electromagnetic cannons back to Earth Orbit.  
Or maybe jobs like that are automated. Or is 
having a friendly human to talk about your day  
a job we want a human specifically to do? Perhaps 
people would be comfortable with a ChatGPT enabled  
Pubbot 3000 with a wider array of cocktail and 
conversational options, who can look up all your  
data and recommend the perfect beverage, selected 
optimally for your unique tastes and preferences,  
for you to share and enjoy!
Or maybe you’re a space farmer,  
waiting for your climate-controlled crops to be 
ready and for a ship to dock and take them away,  
as it does every month, and perhaps almost 
the only visitors your small community,  
or perhaps just your single family, ever get. 
The family farm of 2500 AD might tend to a  
hundred thousand acres of robotic farms in space, 
mere seconds from their client communities for  
conversation or virtual reality, but a few days 
of travel if you want to gossip face to face. 
Or perhaps you live the life of a solar 
array tender, who spends the days running  
inspection and repair robots on the huge thin 
arrays, and goes EVA every couple days for an  
hour to float on a structure no thicker 
than paper but as large as most cities,  
and yet populated by you and your five crewmates. 
Space is immense, and its future will run  
unnumbered trillions of years, and so almost 
anything we might imagine might occur in it,  
and that should include a trillion different jobs 
and billions of different types of facilities,  
each different than each other even when made from 
the same blueprint, and each changing with time. 
Much of our efforts towards living in space are 
about trying to make any given bit of it more like  
Earth, a process we call terraforming, 
while others will attempt the reverse,  
namely adapting to the environment. 
An example of this is bioforming,  
where you alter people to the environment, an 
extreme case of which would be giving someone  
gills to live on an oceanic planet, for instance.
We are not contemplating anything so large today,  
but we must be mindful again of just how 
huge space is, in time as well as volume,  
and some colony established on an ocean planet 
near the galactic rim after a series of leapfrog  
settlements of a dozen prior worlds spread 
out over a million years might be far more  
divergent from us than what even a million 
years of evolution and cultural change might  
naturally allow for. Growing up under alien 
suns and with access to a vast knowledge of  
genetics and cybernetics might mean our 
distant children on that world shared  
less with us of mind and body than an animal 
that ever walked our world or swam its seas. 
But again, our focus for today is much closer 
to home in space and time, and those represent  
problems enough. To shine a light on those 
topics, we might as well begin with light itself. 
It’s been almost 150 years since Edison 
demonstrated his carbon filament light bulb,  
more than twice as long as it’s been 
since the first humans went to space,  
and so it is easy to forget how new artificial 
lighting truly is. Candles and fires were very  
inefficient and expensive ways to allow enough 
light to work when the sun went down, so we  
didn’t get much done at night. Electric lighting 
changed that, the result being we are much more  
used to artificial lighting than our ancestors.
Our modern civilization relies heavily on  
artificial lighting and that would seem sufficient 
proof humans can be comfortable with artificial  
lighting, but the data coming out these days 
is indicating that such a relationship might  
be a lot rockier than we had thought and that in 
many cases it behooves us to aim for as close an  
approximation to sunlight as possible.
Inside our own solar system at least,  
natural light is in the right spectrum, as it’s 
the same sun, except the brutal frequencies of  
ultraviolet are filtered out by our atmosphere. 
However, space away from any planet’s shadow is a  
perpetual noon-time summer desert light, without 
any evening or sunset. Some asteroid miners  
making their way out to the Belt or combing it for 
prospects will never see night, for months on end,  
as the Sun slowly grows dimmer as they journey 
out, but never disappears. I don’t think I’d  
sleep well that way, in a world with no nights, 
nor afternoons and evenings, just eternal noon. 
While we often talk about how light would be 
brighter or dimmer on another planet, or its day  
and year shorter or longer, the color temperatures 
matter a lot too. This can get confusing because  
before we did much science on light, we had our 
normal old rainbow of colors and red, orange,  
and yellow (flame colors, which came to be called 
‘warm’ colors); and green, blue, and violet,  
the ‘cool’ colors. In reality almost all the 
particles of light, photons, coming off a normal  
open flame are in the infrared and only a handful 
are visible, mostly in your red and orange colors. 
If you’re wearing something blue by a campfire 
sometime, you’ll notice it seems especially dark,  
bordering on black, because that fire emits 
virtually no blue light to reflect off it.  
Green would be a bit less dark while violet would 
be even darker. As we turn that flame up, make it  
hotter, the amount of green, blue and violet light 
will increase, while the portion that is infrared  
will decrease. If you look at a torch flame, it’s 
blue near the tip, where it’s hottest. So too,  
a hot piece of metal in a fire might begin to 
glow red, as it heats up it shifts to orange, then  
yellow, and then it is usually so bright we are 
flooded with all wavelengths and it seems white.  
Our Sun’s peak temperature wavelength is actually 
a blueish-green, but none of us perceive that,  
as Earth’s atmosphere scatters short 
wavelength photons. Hence a blue sky. 
Unfortunately, we’re stuck with that 
terminology of warm and cool colors,  
so you will see a bulb listed as 3000 
Kelvin and ‘warm’ while a 6000 Kelvin bulb,  
twice as hot and giving off a spectrum like our 
Sun does, is called ‘cool’. And let’s be honest,  
those warmer but actually colder 
temperature lights in the 2000 to  
3000 Kelvin range are more relaxing and 
warming hues. Those are the colors you  
get more in the evening and morning and thus 
it’s no real surprise it’s relaxing to us. 
We’re only just starting to gather good 
data on what light works best for people  
in what circumstances, as LED lights have made it 
affordable to use basically any spectrum you want,  
but the evidence is lining up that we are 
very touchy about color temperature for  
our environments. Blue light is not relaxing and 
not conducive to getting to sleep. Conveniently,  
our Sun is one of the hotter ones, for 
all that we call it a yellow dwarf star,  
it’s bigger and hotter than about 
95% of the stars in this Universe. 
So what does all this mean for living in space?
Well, up in orbit on some space hotel where you  
whip around the planet every 90 minutes, enjoying 
fast sunrises and sunsets at that same rate,  
you cannot allow anything like a natural day to 
come in through windows, even UV-shielded windows.  
Your sleeping quarters need to be absent of any 
outside light, which is fine since we have found  
that the best sleep comes from the least light 
and noise. Trust me, an investment in a black  
out curtains and a good mattress are good ones. 
We think of a space hotel as a place to visit for  
its microgravity environment, but I’m certain 
it won’t take long for them to get rated by  
how comfy their beds or sleeping cocoons are, and 
how good a night of sleep the wealthy tourist had. 
How do we build a space habitat 
with good lighting without having  
to produce it entirely artificially?
It’s tricky and depends a lot on what  
the other conditions are. For instance, it’s 
impossible in Low Orbit, again, that 90-minute  
day-night cycle is in play. You could possibly 
use a system of mirrors and lenses to blast light  
from ahead or behind your orbit to light you 
during your day when you’re behind the Earth,  
but that seems needlessly complicated in 
favor of just enclosing the whole environment,  
except a few observation windows, and lighting 
it with the best approximation of a normal day’s  
length and light temperatures, even 
incorporating seasonal variations. 
I think that’s likely to be your solution at most 
places, but in higher orbits of Earth where a  
space habitat wouldn’t spend much time in Earth’s 
shadow, and the orbital periods get longer,  
you could have your space habitat spinning along 
an axis parallel to the direction of sunlight.  
Then you stick whatever filters you want in place 
to block out light of the desired frequencies,  
and change them over the day and season 
to mimic a given region of Earth.  
You can also bounce or direct that excess 
light into power collectors, or power storage,  
or running something like fuel production or metal 
refining, or secondary space farms or hydroponics  
in lower-quality, cheaper, adjacent facilities.
This works essentially anywhere except on, or in,  
a planet, major or minor, or in low orbit of it. 
You can even put a big parabolic dish behind your  
hab to bounce in a larger amount of sunlight if 
you’re far from the Sun. It’s paper thin, or even  
thinner, so not much of an extra cost even way 
out in deep space, as we discussed in more detail  
in our recent look at Colonizing the Kuiper Belt.
This is going to be a bit of a theme when it comes  
to planets and living in space, that it tends to 
be way easier to make the blank template of space  
into something Earthlike than it is to reshape a 
planet. You have a blank if hostile canvas to work  
with, not one already painted Martian red, so to 
speak. Of all the planets, only Mars has anything  
close to our day length, being a half hour longer 
and presumably allowing some extra sleep each day.  
The other rocky planets have day lengths measured 
in months, while the gas giants are all shorter,  
with Jupiter at 10 hours, Saturn 11, Uranus 17, 
and Neptune 16 hours. Most asteroids spin around  
even faster than that, and only a handful of 
tiny moons near Jupiter and Saturn have day  
lengths of 24 hours or less, with most moons 
being tidally locked and having days equal to  
the orbital period around their planet, like 
our Moon, and are often weeks or months long. 
As we move to a gravity environment, this problem 
only gets worse. We know microgravity is bad for  
people in the long term, but we have no idea 
how little is enough. Only 12 humans have ever  
existed in low gravity, and only for a few days 
each in lunar gravity, with that stay bookended  
by high-g rocket burns and periods of microgravity 
moving to the Moon and back. So, for all we know,  
the Moon and the dozen or so other bigger moons in 
this solar system might be just fine for humans.  
In which case, settling them is far easier, 
whereas if it isn’t, then we may use human  
repair crews on short month-long contracts and 
have robots on the ground, or remote control them  
from spin gravity habitats orbiting those moons.
And if gravity is too low on those moons, maybe  
Mars is fine, at about two-fifths Earth’s 
gravity. Or maybe even Venus and Saturn,  
each within about 10% of Earth’s gravity, would 
still not be close enough. Earth’s gravity has  
been the same over the entire duration of life 
here and varies by far less than 1% from pole  
to equator or valley to mountain top. Nothing is 
adapted to gravitational variation. We could find  
that some ecologies totally fall apart even 
at just under a 1% difference in gravity, so  
that even the cloud cities and floating gardens of 
Venus, floating a hundred miles over the surface,  
need constant tinkering to help with gravitational 
issues of its near-Earth gravity. Perhaps your job  
there as a botanist or zoologist is helping 
with that tinkering and adjusting for the  
gravity not being quite right, and your spouse 
helps run the local tourist rental for gliders  
and blimps and acid-proof pressure suits.
My hunch is that the gravity on Venus would  
not be a problem at all, but science is about 
rigorously testing hunches and as of right now,  
we haven’t developed the means to test this one. 
It may be that our tolerance and adaptability,  
and those of our fellow organisms, is so high 
and quick that even bizarre environments with  
just 1% gravity would be able to be adapted to. 
Places where we’re floating in 3D environments  
and where you glide around like a bird are 
easy to create and dwell-in. Those habitats  
might sport trees a dozen kilometers tall 
or wide, with entire glades or pools hidden  
in the various nooks of their branches. While 
micro-gravity trees might grow out spherically. 
But it is very important to know for our future 
because that future looks very different if humans  
can handle low gravity very easily or if treatment 
for microgravity health concerns become simple and  
routine. So too, a civilization with easy cancer 
treatment might build very different ships, domes,  
stations and other settlements than one 
that dies easily from radiation exposure. 
Alternatively, we can say that humans 
experiencing acceleration from being spun  
around, like a car going around a sharp turn 
or laundry in the spin cycle, does show every  
evidence of simulating gravity sufficiently, 
with a few caveats we’ll get to in a moment. 
First, some do wonder how we know gravity and this 
sort of use of centrifugal force can approximate  
each other, and the answer is right there in 
things like the microgravity in space stations or  
any satellite around our planet or any other moon 
or planet for that matter. They don’t fall down  
toward the planet because the centrifugal force 
of them whipping around that object counteracts  
the falling. That’s why astronauts float on the 
space station, and it’s also why you wouldn’t  
float if you jumped up towards the center inside 
a rotating space habitat. It would seem like  
you would float off the ground in a spinning 
cylinder, and indeed you would if you magically  
appeared inside one by teleportation, at least 
until all the air started shoving you around,  
but the same is true if you teleported in over 
Earth, there will be an instant before gravity  
affects you, or vice versa, since it travels at 
light speed. And then you would fall under the  
power of gravity. The real confusion comes from 
people not really thinking through how you jumped  
off the surface of that ring or cylinder to get 
suspended in the air, and not carrying through the  
inertia or looking at the force chart of jumping 
off the floor while both you and it are moving. 
TL;DR if you’re content to accept that 
spin-gravity works fine – I’ve never  
heard another physicist object to it working 
this way either – but often folks hear about  
the idea and it confuses them or they think the 
idea is something out of sci-fi or fringe physics  
when it’s terribly mundane and old school. 
It’s just a pain to visualize and requires  
messing around with rotating non-inertial 
reference frames, which is also a pain. 
The other half of that skepticism, I think, comes 
from the lack of any existing space stations with  
spinning sections. However, this comes down to 
three key facts. First, one of the major points  
of us having a space station is that we can do 
experiments in space there, and the only thing we  
can’t really emulate down here that is up there, 
is that near absence of gravity – or rather,  
that near-perfect balance of centrifugal force 
and gravity to create that weightless microgravity  
environment. We could build a big long tunnel 
around the planet’s equator, suck the air out  
of it, and run a hyperloop-style vacuum train 
around the planet at thousands of miles per hour  
and achieve the same thing but as expensive as 
space stations are to build, that would be worse.  
Admittedly it would have great travel uses.
Anyway, putting gravity onto the only place  
we can conduct zero gravity experiments is kind 
of self-defeating. I suspect we will find many  
folks enjoy microgravity in our early space 
hotels but soon find they would like at least  
partial gravity in their hotel room itself. 
It certainly makes plumbing easier and less  
embarrassing. Those people aren’t living in space, 
but may be the customers of the first people who  
really do. When it comes to your hotel staff, 
which is not usually a very high-paying job,  
it might be that the cost of bringing them 
up to space and down is so prohibitive that  
such companies pay extra bonuses to those who 
stay on longer between trips home to Earth. 
The second reason is, it’s more expensive to 
build since you have either a large cylinder, wide  
enough for reasonable spin gravity, or you make a 
ring or torus, and for the latter that means you  
have even more surface for air to leak out from 
and radiation to leak through, raising costs. 
And third, while we could have a station that had 
a spinning section connected to a non-spinning  
section, that is a lot harder to do than it sounds 
as you have a collar, or section, trying to mate  
those two bits up that has to be airtight. It is 
doable but it is also a hassle and tends to result  
in some leakage – which is fine, all stations 
leak – and needing some power to keep the section  
spinning. Any strictly rotating space station 
doesn’t require any power to keep it spinning  
once you get it up there, but I suspect most real 
space habitats will still have to use some way to  
handle matching that up to whatever non-rotating 
structures attach to them. For instance,  
it’s handy to place a habitation cylinder, or 
hab drum, inside a thicker non-rotating sheath,  
superstructure, or hollowed region of an asteroid.
Now, I mentioned that spin-gravity wasn’t a  
perfect match with normal gravity and a key part 
of that is that you have to spin faster and faster  
the smaller you want to make a habitat and people 
get nauseous from rotation. You may be watching  
this on a swivel chair and if you’re like me and 
have it at a U-shaped desk, then it is normal  
to rotate that chair partly around or all the 
way around a few times a minute, and it would  
be normal for doing that to cause no nausea, not 
like the dizziness of just lifting your feet and  
spinning around in that chair every few seconds 
and repeatedly. This is the nausea we worry about  
for spin habitats and it is quite mundane, but it 
means that anyone in a ring or habitat that’s only  
a dozen feet wide has to spin around 22 times per 
minute, or 22 RPM. They would also find that their  
head, near the center of the spinning cylinder, 
was experiencing virtually no gravity effect,  
and indeed if they were over 6 feet tall 
or jumped a bit or stepped on a footstool,  
their head would now be experiencing not just low 
or no gravity, but instead, a small upward tug. 
Studies have shown that low-radius 
spinning habitats are intolerable  
due to Coriolis forces. A maximum rate 
of rotation of 2 rpm is often specified,  
although some studies have indicated humans could 
adapt to 4 rpm. A maximum rotation rate of 2 rpm  
producing 1g gives a radius of 224 m. If a rate 
of 4 rpm is considered acceptable, the radius can  
be reduced to 56 m, 184 feet. A rotation rate 
of 22 rpm is impractical, at least for humans. 
Spin gravity grows with distance from the center 
of spin; twice as far away, twice the gravity.  
This is the opposite of normal gravity, which 
is inverse square, meaning twice as far away,  
one fourth the gravity. So it’s actually easier 
to work with in that regard than normal gravity  
but it means your station, while not needing 
to be anywhere near the size of a planet,  
does need to be big enough that folks walking 
around it experience no significant change in  
gravity between head and feet, and also the first 
floor and second floor of a building… although  
lower gravity at different heights might actually 
be a popular feature. You could, for example,  
have an Earth-gravity floor, a Mars-gravity floor, 
and a lunar-gravity floor, as contemplated in  
the Gateway Space Station design some years back.
All of this means we tend to be looking at either  
creating a moderately low gravity environment, 
like simulating Martian gravity in Earth orbit, or  
something that is at least 1467 feet wide, or 447 
meters, to achieve that 2 RPM threshold at normal  
Earth gravity. Needless to say that’s outside 
the price tag of what we are ready to pay right  
now for a space station. We usually assume this 
is a ring or cylinder of that diameter but what  
we call a hammer hab works too, which is where you 
have your rotating sections swinging around on a  
tether, or similar, rather than a complete ring.
And while we’re pretty confident 2 RPM as a  
rotation rate should be fine for any human, we 
can’t be quite as sure that would be true of other  
organisms, and the same for gravity variation.
Which takes us to the discussion on non-human  
life, by which I don’t mean aliens, at least 
not in the classic sense. Humans are probably  
fairly normal examples of how mammals will handle 
something like an O’Neill Cylinder, a big wide  
hab drum whose full-size version is comparable 
in living area to your typical US county. At 5  
miles or 8 kilometers wide, they only rotate once 
every two minutes or half an RPM, so, not nausea  
inducing. Such an environment is big enough to 
create real ecosystems, not just boxes in space  
for humans and some short term experiments.
But if you’re trying to replicate whole  
ecosystems, you do have to worry about how fragile 
your most sensitive critter is. As an example,  
I really doubt any mobile organism is going to 
have a problem with spinning around once every  
other minute, otherwise it would have a rough time 
moving to flee predators or prey on something,  
which is rather the point of being 
mobile. Trees might be more sensitive,  
not being mobile, given that earth only spins 
once a day or 0.0007 RPM, however they have to  
survive wind and gusts, so they are probably not 
that sensitive. We don’t actually know though. 
On the other hand we do know that bees navigate 
using the Sun and its ultraviolet light,  
so if you are spinning that hab at 0.5 RPM, 
not 0.0007 RPM, that might really mess with  
their ability to use it to navigate by. The 
rest of us might not like having a window  
that looked out at the starry night and swung 
completely around every two minutes either.  
Physically spinning around in circles isn’t 
the only way to get motion sickness after all. 
So you enclose your cylinder and control light 
coming in or create it entirely artificially,  
including non-visible frequencies like UV or 
infrared. That is all doable but it definitely  
takes extra effort; and, moreover, while 
that lets you fix the gravity to whatever  
you like and the lighting and day and year 
length, unlike any planet you might settle,  
but the more things you have to get right, 
and the narrower the range we find ourselves  
and our fellow earth organisms can handle, the 
harder and more expensive this all gets. That  
brings up that balancing act of terraforming 
versus adapting yourself to the environment  
and with bioforming as an extreme example of that.
We might find we’re okay with modifying honeybees  
to work differently - or just use some other 
pollinator - we already have been breeding bees  
and other critters to be more docile or productive 
for thousands of years, now we just have better  
technology for that and likely will be even better 
at it down the road. The thing is, tinkering with  
an organism is also tinkering with an ecosystem, 
as even a small change in one organism can throw  
everything else out of whack as a result. Think 
about a forest in which beavers were far more  
common and productive and predator resistant. 
Before long, there is probably a lot less forest. 
Some things might be easy adaptations of time. 
We presumably did not evolve living under roofs,  
but it’s normal to us now, and having your blue 
sky replaced by a green lawn or forest hanging  
overhead is probably doable. But we have often 
found that things we would assume we would handle  
easily were surprisingly rough on us physically or 
psychologically. We have ways we could fix that,  
including a fake sky on a smaller cylinder nested 
inside the main one. But we also have ways to  
combine spin gravity and normal gravity[g] to make 
higher-gravity habitats on low gravity planets.  
We can use solar shades and mirrors to adjust 
apparent day length, including seasonal variation,  
or even brute force-alter a planet’s rotation or 
mass. We’ve discussed heavy-handed approaches to  
terraforming in other episodes and they’re 
not that far-fetched in a practical sense. 
All of these habitats or terraforming 
operations require a lot of effort to  
accomplish, not to mention cost, but 
that always needs a caveat of scale.  
Greater technology and automation allow modern 
humans to enjoy houses that most kings of yore  
would call a palace and envied. And that they 
would immediately attempt to seize for themself.  
I don’t think most folks used to watching 
or reading about those cultures in fantasy  
or history tend to realize how small and cramped 
your typical castle or great house was. As well  
as dirty and hot or cold. Better technology 
and automation allow us to do things easier,  
and we are not that far away from being able to 
not just have factories mostly run by robots but  
robots that build other robots and which require 
less attention and control than modern ones. 
How expensive is it really to terraform a planet 
if you can dump one vial of bacteria on it, which  
can grow and reproduce, then come back a thousand 
years later and find that planet has got air,  
soil and basic organisms on it[h]? Well-engineered 
machinery that does similar is presumably just as  
possible and need not be totally independent in 
reproduction. We can have a robot ecosystem of  
thousands of different types of robots big and 
small, and we can set that up so that they are  
not independently reproducing like our organisms 
do. The simpler and more repetitive the task, the  
easier that is to design and oversee construction 
or maintenance of, and fundamentally a giant  
rotating habitat is not much different than one a 
tenth its size. Much as a freeway is huge compared  
to a carefully carved stone statue, size is not a 
great indicator about effort and cost, and varies  
a ton based on technology, especially as a 3D 
concrete printer or robot with a chisel arm might  
make statues very fast and cheap too.
So we can’t trust our intuitive sense  
of what is practical versus ridiculously 
over the top when thinking about the scale  
of megastructure construction or terraforming. 
That’s why this show discusses concepts like  
building Dyson swarms or englobing black holes 
or even making a black hole, because as huge as  
englobing Dyson swarms are, they are allowed 
under known science and aren’t prohibitively  
complicated. They are conceptually simple and 
they are thought to be physically possible,  
and that means they are plausible to build and not 
necessarily in some future of godlike posthumans. 
Now, it is entirely possible that living in 
space will come after we have transitioned  
into some transhuman or post-human state that no 
longer needs nor wants terrestrial ecosystems,  
or one that has been wiped out by AI who 
similarly doesn’t need those kinds of ecosystems,  
and I would argue both of those are alive 
and thus would fall into the scope of our  
episode for today. However, this episode is less 
interested in physical modifications to humans or  
what some cyborg, AI, or alien might be doing.
So let’s talk about the cultural changes that  
living in space offers. First, one of our 
strengths and weaknesses as a species is  
that we are social by nature and required to 
be by practical life. We have to mostly get  
along with our neighbors at a day to day level 
and have a lot of customs for managing that,  
which vary from culture to culture, many of 
which are influenced by the local environment  
and technologies, and space would be no different. 
However, it does present some unique problems and  
advantages. For instance, just as some planet 
with a 26 hour day and two moons, one orbiting  
every 8 days and one every 32, is likely to 
have a culture built around that, folks in  
artificial habitats can choose to build a culture 
around the number ten if they really wanted to,  
going for a 100 minute hour, ten per day, ten 
days a week, 10 weeks a month, 10 months a year,  
and so on; which would certainly be easier to 
learn and work with than our modern timekeeping. 
This is a similar situation with post-scarcity 
economies – the kind that have robots and are just  
ridiculously prosperous by modern standards, 
because they basically have the resources to  
make any system work if they’re just stubborn 
about it. Folks debate about which system is  
more efficient - capitalism, socialism, communism, 
anarchy, etc. - but a post-scarcity civilization  
can probably get away with picking its leaders and 
policy by random lots or using a Ouija board or  
bowl of alphabet soup to pick their next king. 
That’s probably not stable in the long term,  
but then again, nothing really is, and the 
nature of the sort of civilizations that grow  
out of massive automation and energy abundance 
is that they are so huge in scope and possible  
population that you are almost bound to have 
semi-functional examples of virtually any crazy  
system in place at any given time somewhere, and 
possibly supporting itself in-part on tourism  
from folks wanting to see that in action, 
like some wild west reenactment village. 
That’s one of the big draws to space 
for a lot of us, if you can imagine it,  
th[i]is sort of civilization can make it a reality 
– admittedly so can virtual reality – and what’s  
nice about that in a peaceful sense isn’t that 
there’s more than enough room for everybody in  
the immensity of space. That’s poetic but it’s 
really our neighbors that set our teeth on edge,  
not the weird loonies in that other country with 
that bizarre habit of theirs we’ve heard about.  
VR and the internet let you interact with people 
all over who share your less common habits,  
and what’s really cool about space habitats is 
that they are inherently mobile and smaller so  
people can individually migrate and so can 
whole communities. If two O’ Neill Cylinders  
in a local swarm can’t stand each other, 
one can undock and move to another swarm. 
But surely space itself has some 
cultural changes inherent to it?[j][k] 
Well, yes, I think so, especially in the near 
term. Recycling might be an example. Everything  
about living in space is about needing to be good 
at recovering and reusing resources and even a  
very post-scarcity civilization is bound by this.
In big space habitats, there may be little need to  
make rooms airtight in homes or personal quarters, 
or to walk around in a spacesuit. In other places,  
some sort of pressure suit might be routine as 
clothing. It might be comfortable clothing too,  
as light as a sweater, or even a feather, using 
advanced materials, or maybe heavy and thick  
but interwoven with servos and electronics 
and radiating tubes so that you don’t just  
have the machines in your gear carrying their own 
weight, but possibly intuitively amplifying your  
own strength and speed.[l] Or maybe the technology 
never improves as much, and on asteroid colonies  
kids learn how to rapidly don their spacesuit 
helmet in the same way we learn to look both  
ways to cross the road, or tie our shoes, or know 
where the fire exits in a building are located.  
And maybe the built-in recyclers on their bulky 
suits are so good and practical that they don’t  
take them off much. They use the bathroom in them, 
the internal systems clean their skin[m][n] and  
remove waste and so on. Maybe they sleep in them. 
Given that we spend our early years in diapers,  
this might be an easy adaptation for kids born 
and raised there, queasy as it sounds to us. 
Other places might have habitats so idyllic 
they require no houses with ceiling or walls for  
protection from the elements[o], and no spacesuit 
or even clothes for the inhabitants. Meanwhile,  
other places might be so inherently harsh that 
living in a spacesuit all the time is the only  
real option besides cybernetic alteration. 
And of course many might choose that,  
or already have chosen it before going to 
space, indeed the term cyborg originates from  
discussion of adapting people to living in space.
In the end, we could tell a million stories about  
how life might be in space and barely crack the 
surface of the options a future humanity will  
have to explore, but one thing seems sure, given 
many, many options for living here on Earth, and  
how tiny that is compared to space, the future for 
those living there seems practically limitless.
There’s a thousand stories we could delve into 
about living in space, but one that really  
spoke to me to delve into more since writing this 
episode a few months back was Life as a Asteroid  
Miner, and so we have a Nebula Original exploring 
what it might be like to be out in the Belt in the  
centuries to come prospecting for minerals and if 
we would see lone miners on asteroids or big teams  
or something more like the mining camps of the 
California Gold Rush and the sorts of suddenly  
booming communities or ghost towns that sometimes 
followed and what that lifestyle and community  
progression might look like in a space setting.
If you want to see that bonus episode you can  
subscribe to Nebula, our streaming service, where 
you not only get to see every regular episode of  
SFIA a few days early and ad free, but all our 
other bonus content, including extended editions  
of many episodes, and more Nebula Original 
episodes like, Nomadic Miners on the Moon,  
Space Freighters, Retrocausality, Orch Or 
& Free Will, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology,  
Colonizing Binary Stars, and more.
Nebula has tons of great content from  
an ever-growing community of creators. Using 
my link and discount it’s available now for  
just over $2.50 a month, less than the price of 
the drink or snack you might have been enjoying  
during the episode, and it goes to supporting 
new content from myself and other creators. 
When you sign up at my link, 
https://go.nebula.tv/isaacarthur and use my code,  
isaacarthur, you not only get access to all of the 
great stuff Nebula offers, you’ll also be directly  
supporting this show. Again, to see SFIA early, 
ad free, and with all the exclusive bonus content,

One last quick note, folks often ask if  
we’re doing another lifetime membership drive 
for Nebula and for the month of September 2023  
you can get a lifetime membership, for 
as long as both you and Nebula exist,  
for $300. Which goes to developing more and 
bigger Nebula Originals and platform improvement,  
and if you sign up using my code, isaacarthur, 
a third of that goes directly to the channel. 
So that’s it for today but we’re just starting 
for September. On the 14th we’ll ask about the  
Interplanetary Infrastructure we need to build 
in our solar system to colonize it, and then  
we’ll jump into Scifi Sunday on September 17th to 
celebrate the SFIA’s 9th birthday with the Fermi  
Paradox: Fallen Empires. Then on the 21st we’ll 
talk about how we can mine atmospheres like those  
on Venus or Titan, or even Gas Giants and Stars. 
Then we’ll close out the month with our Livestream  
Q&A on Sunday, September 24th, and then on the 
28th we will have an exploration of what traveling  
the galaxy as an adventurer or lone wanderer 
will be like in Have Space Suit - Will Travel. 
If you’d like to get alerts when those and other 
episodes come out, make sure to hit the like,

As always, thanks for watching,  
and have a Great Week!
[a]is this a book that viewers  
can get access to? maybe a link can be placed 
in the video description if this is the case. 
[b]Do we still believe that spaceship crew would 
wear suits all the time? For the entire voyage?  
This was mentioned in Surviving The Expanse Of 
Space but a lot of people on the subreddit find  
that idea dubious. If so, would individualize 
customize their suits as a form of expression?
This could be a whole episode 
in itself, come to think of it. 
[c]I have been thinking about it :) Life 
as an asteroid miner is a July image poll  
topic. But I think it comes down to how bulks 
a suit is, it might be like wearing overalls,  
or bulkier but comfortable.

[d]I think that'd be great, either a quick note in  
this episode as an example of day-to-day life 
or as a full blown episode in it's own right. 
[e]Would that job be automated? Or is having 
a friendly human to to talk about your day a  
job we *want* a human specifically to do?
[f]I should add a note about that later,  
re chatGPT

[g]What. The. Fork. :) Make that an episode. :) 
[h]That's not us, that's engineers from 
Prometheus. As for us, by the time your  
vial gets to the surface, it probably lands on 
the roof of some unauthorised settlement. :D 
[i]this?
[j]I think the Overveiw effect is worth  
mentioning in this section too. I presume you 
know if it, but in case not people who have been  
to space have a huge shift in their outlook of the 
world having seen if from orbit. A society where a  
huge portion of the population has had this happen 
to them is bound to view things different to us. 
[k]There's a lot of the book of the same 
name discussing it, we can add it in,  
I just tend to wonder how well documented it 
really is and how mch is just being in space,  
as opposed ot on a vital mission etc.
[l]Future Fashion episode? 
[m]I'd really love to know if anyone's figured 
out a way to take a bath inside a space suit.  
LOL Do we just throw nanobots at it or can 
we actually flood every part of suit (but  
the helmet) and then drain/dry it? Maybe even 
leverage nearby space vacuum to evaporate-dry  
the skin before re-pressurizing?
[n]You could potentially do something  
like reversed pores on the inside of the 
spacesuit, soap-sweat cleaning things away,  
but barring smehting like that I think 
you'd have to remove it occasionally for  
cleaning or go those other routes you mentioned.
[o]This is actually something I was thinking about  
the other day. We're used to thinking of indoors 
vs outdoors, but in an O'Neill Cylinder theres  
there need to be two outdoors? I bet we'll 
see just a blend of public vs private spaces,  
both featuring plant and nature features. Your 
"bedroom" might have a tiny babbling brook or moss  
flooring. Habitat interior 
decorating is going to be wild!
