The Bernal Sphere is perhaps the oldest space
habitat design, dating to 1929, and is a hollow
sphere originally designed to be 10 miles
or 16 kilometers in diameter, in which inhabitants
would live inside.
The original design by Bernal hollows an asteroid
out to build a sphere around it, which may
be replaced with a wider one as you grow,
and considers a hollow transparent outer sphere
for sunlight.
In this way asteroid mines in space might
slowly turn themselves into larger habitats
for bigger populations and more diversified
economies.
Others, such as Gerard K. O’Neill, would
refine the design, as his Island One and Island
Two stations, and introduce rotation to give
the station spin-gravity inside.
The Babylon 5 TV show features a Bernal Sphere
of this type.
For more examples of space habitats, such
as O’Neill’s Island three design, known
as the O’Neill Cylinder, see our episode,
the Megastructure Compendium.
