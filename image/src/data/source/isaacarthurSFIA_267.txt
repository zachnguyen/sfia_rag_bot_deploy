good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly livestream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window so our
moderators can start relaying those to
me as soon as we start please try to
keep the questions concise and watch
your spelling and try to be polite to
others in the chat
we usually go for about an hour so you
probably want to grab a drink and a
snack though we'll take a break about
halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
good afternoon everyone and welcome to
our monthly live stream q a here on sfia
we'll be taking all your questions and
getting to a couple of ones we missed
from last week to begin with while
you're getting those in the moderators
as usual we are joined by my lovely wife
sarah who will be asking us questions
today
and uh
there you go what's our first question
to start off from video yes so we had a
couple questions we were unable to get
to last week one of which was would you
have a home observatory
um i think the problem we would have
here is why i'd love to have an
observatory and i actually was the grad
student of operators when i was at
college uh we had a little observatory
at kent state that i'd run on friday
nights
um is that we live right by two freeways
and uh as a result of that
we have an awful lot of light noise even
though we're out in the middle of
nowhere all foam is
in a very dark area except for the
gigantic lights from the freeway
interchange right behind us
which means that it's not in a very dark
area it is yeah there's a lot of light
noise
the uh darkest part of the house is
underneath my patio on the east side and
uh wouldn't see a lot of sky from there
but there's just there's too much noise
enough here and some light there
so yanny b says have you ever thought
about writing a sci-fi novel i have i
was just thinking i i can actually
garden at nighttime which is one upside
that much lighting there um but uh
the thing about science fiction novels
they take a long time to write and like
everybody else who's a big sci-fi fan
especially somebody who obviously writes
a lot uh and i do obviously write a lot
i think we turn out the equivalent of
like four books a year of a certain like
that obviously big demonstrate a long
like doorstop or fantasy novel and uh
the more classic you know paperbacks of
like 200 pages from back when i was
younger
um
and uh we turned about for the smaller
variety of video
but um
the thing about
writing those they would take a lot of
time out and the other thing about that
is
a lot of people want to write a novel
just because they want to write a novel
i want to write a novel if a story calls
out to me to be written that people are
going to enjoy you know
i have the luxury of knowing that if i
put a novel out um it's going to sell
pretty decently just because i have an
audience that already would like to read
something like that and that's awesome
however
i'm not going to turn one out less i
think it's a story that they should
actually take their time to read as
opposed to just something i put out
because i thought it would have a good
chance of you know selling and uh
that time hasn't come yet when it does i
will write that thing in a heartbeat but
in the meantime i'm really happy just to
develop all that world building stuff
for other people to use and you know
there was i got a bookshelf full of
people right now that have written books
inspired by the show and i love them i
love knowing that we have that many
novels we've inspired in some way
but uh until i actually feel one that's
inspired by me to write a novel i'm not
going to go there
well sabotage thank you very much for
your super chat
could orbital solar generators create
problematic changes with earth-specific
energy generators between the earth and
sun reduce solar energy while the others
add energy both change the energy sure
um it can i mean you'd be talking about
a pretty big difference
the earth would see something like
what is it we have 500
million 510 million square kilometers of
surface area on this planet you got that
half a cross section
um you know a square kilometer solar
panel is going to generate you around a
gigawatt up in space
that's as much as a nuclear power plant
right so uh you're looking at one out of
500 million to drink one regular power
plant now as i was talking about big
shades big solar meals things like that
specifically the intent of changing the
weather or blocking sunlight absolutely
yeah
you don't have to have it as a net zero
process though um earth is six thousand
seven hundred kilometers in radius so
four thousand miles um
this distance of the geosynchronous
orbit is about six times that or four
times that somewhere in that zone with
that squared in terms of actual
available sunlight coming in and there's
orbits above that too we don't know
they're just uh geosynchronous and even
higher orbits to put these things in
and so you can arrange to have all your
solar coming bouncing down and
collecting more you just have to make
sure you're paying attention what it is
it wouldn't be that hard to calculate
and then you modify as needed
welcome back to channel regular isaac
bradeau out of all the inventions you
would say are safe bets for the 21st
century what do you think would be the
most important or impactful
that is such a hard thing to to always
kind of put into context uh we sought to
look at you know what increased salt
production in terms of either energy or
robotization of manpower and those were
big factors in 20 in the 20th century as
was the 19th century you can't look at
the basic factory setup of the 19th
century and its improvements in the 20th
century some robotization or the you
know the mention of your your bigger
engines than in the 20th century in the
19th century your nuclear power plant in
the 20th century and say these weren't
big factors they were but at the same
time i'm not sure they qualify as the
biggest computers by
themselves were very big so a lot of
other you know minor things you wouldn't
think about like a paper clip there are
a million little tiny inventions that
have added that one percent here they
are to our productivity that has been a
big thing is worse to our standard of
living you know it's uh refrigerator is
a big invention and uh how about the
freezer the freezer ice cream cream
and the air conditioner not happen to
have all salted food
you didn't have to have you could freeze
stuff and then you not have to be the
latter you can actually keep it all year
round
um
you know those are huge game changers in
how we live so in terms of the ones i
think it was definite for the 21st
century
that's always hard to say i really would
fall back to the energy ones uh to much
improve solar power and batteries for
the moment i'd love to see fusion
obviously overall sort of but i think
for now i'll you know generation four or
five nuclear reactors or solar panel
improvements and then the other energy
types too i don't like to just underplay
wind and geo like they don't exist but
solo and nuclear are the ones mass
produce energy and um
and pretty much anywhere whereas uh
robotization is also another big one too
but
a lot of it's in the software side now
those little improvements are the
software angles that make it easier to
keep track of your life keep track of
you know your exercise your calories
your sleep patterns your oil health
those are the ones that could be the
refrigerator or the next century and
they are standard living increases
so thank you tkg wildfire for your super
chat how would you devise an electric
rocket or a space plane something that
can get from the surface to space
um
in our space planes episode we detailed
you talked about beaming energy down the
surface with solar for instance we
detailed how you could actually do that
same thing with a scramjet
uh a scramjet and two electrical your
ramjet are kind of your ultimate and
really simple devices that only need
heat to run people tend to assume that
there's something ultra high tech about
the design of a scramjet uh it is
literally a stovepipe the geometry of
the thing is you build it has it there's
no moving part other than the thing that
injects the hot flame in there
and uh that doesn't have to be produced
by that imagine for the moment you had
an airplane that had a big rectangle to
absorb microwaves coming in and that was
just shaped as the engine the scramjet
engine now as it's moving forward a
certain speed it's got microwaves being
down from the surface
and it's just getting hot air blasted
through it by that from the ground that
can take it into space because it
doesn't have to obey the rocket equation
anymore it's not losing fuel if the
energy is coming up from above and it's
using that air breathing rocket from
below
and that's going to keep working at very
high altitudes um and then you can also
cut the power off that too which means
you can let people drive a hypersonic
aircraft comfortable the knowledge that
they start dvd off the course
you can cut that off plus you're
tracking pretty accurately so it is the
thing that lets us start considering
having the space plane in your own
garage because it's just a hard piece of
metal that has to be relatively or you
know air resistant obviously in terms of
very streamlined design but oh that's
all it is it's just the geometry and the
metallogy of the material and now you
have a plane in your house that can take
anywhere around the world
including up to orbit that is not here
yet and you hold
infrastructure around that like with the
cell phone but the cell phone grew up in
about 10 20 years in terms of getting
towers all over the place you can do the
same with mic with microwave beaming so
as you can front in the power so that is
a possibility and i think if we really
do want to have spacecraft or airplanes
in people's home garage that's the way
to go because it also means that's the
big one there's no nuclear reactor or
hundreds of tons of fuel sitting around
in their garage to blow up or get in the
shears it's just the device and whatever
fuel needs to get airborne
speaking of different types of metals
scooter gsp wants to know if the grade
of steel used to make armor plating for
world war ii era warships would make a
good basis for the whole plating of
orbital structures if it could be
manufactured in orbit
i don't actually know what the actual
nature of the steel foam wood wall was
at two you said two two
that that's i'm not a metallurgist uh we
made a lot of improvements in steel
production but usually my interesting
was more like for railroads as opposed
to for all more we have better steel
nowadays the rest of my knowledge we
have some big improvements in that so i
would tend to assume that would be what
we were using but i'd have to punt on
that question because i just i don't
know the metalogy of that animal um
thicker is better for the most part
do you think point-to-point travel on
earth using a starship is a good idea um
it depends do you trust the thing not to
run into the grounds at high speed
um planes moving through the air tend to
decelerate very quickly when you don't
apply energy to them especially until
they get down to
you know 1200 miles an hour right or
kilometers out of that zone
hypersonic stuff is going to slow down
real quick
however uh there's a lot of kinetic
energy there and it doesn't take that
much to turn something like that
down into the ground although you have
to keep in mind 20 radius that they
could shred that plane if you've tried
to turn too quickly right
yeah
and uh you know when sarah and i go
flying uh which we haven't had a chance
a couple weeks now because the weather
around here but uh and schedules but uh
we're flying at what 100 knots uh maybe
120 knots most of the time it's not that
fast and
um you know for context mach 1 is like
600 knots maybe a little bit more than
that and hypersonic speeds that's like
we usually don't even start so we get
the mach 5 and calling it that like 3000
knots something like that
that is a very wide tony radius and
if you are up to what we call orbital
speeds your turning radius to not get
more than a g of toenail yourself while
you're whipping thing around is
literally the radius of the planet
that's how orbit works so
you can't just instantly pull these
planes to the ground but the same time
that is your big limitation is what
keeps people who are flying these things
from crashing them into buildings like
we saw of 9 11 20
21 years back almost sounds fun to
believe
um and uh
you know it's uh
obviously
the ability to cut the power supply
after those things as well as the
ability to track them so carefully
because you're giving them power that
you could just you know there are
alternatives to sending so many
microwaves you certainly need to get rid
of a plane in the sky so those are the
kind of things we'd have to be going to
do in a more automated sense we want to
have that kind of very fast spaceship to
ground personal transport available
otherwise you make them dock up in orbit
welcome back merv johnston thank you for
your super chat he says he's a big fan
of the overlooked ntr and fission
rockets do they have a place in the
future or do you think that less fickle
fusion will become the ultimate engine
for the future of interplanetary travel
what was the last we said was the
ultimate infusion
vision and ntr i know at the end they
said the ultimate one oh was that fusion
i'm a big fan of the overlooked ntr and
fission rockets do they have a place in
the future or do you think that less
fickle fusion will become the ultimate
engine of the future for in a planet if
we get fusion walking we will absolutely
start using fusion a lot more probably
right i always like to put a context on
that my guess is that fusion reactors
will always work better um when they're
bigger than when they're smaller in
terms of efficiency and ears the other
thing to keep in mind always is we say
wow the sun is so powerful
well it's actually not the the sun is is
huge it weighs like 10 to 30 some
kilograms whereas the power output it
puts out is you know 10 to 24 right and
you get this difference where it takes
about a thousand kilograms
of fusion or 10 000 kilograms of fusion
metal in the core of a stall to produce
enough actual power
to light a light bulb one light bulb
most of our engines are fuel spies are a
lot more compact than that because
fusion is a very slow process as well
says we can't just you know we're not
trying to replicate the circumstances
inside of stars people are saying about
fusion we're trying to replicate what's
going on inside a star no we're not no
we're not we're trying to replicate what
goes on inside a supernova
we can do a star that's that's not that
bad
so
uh that is the one limitation i would
say on fusion is unless you can actually
get it to power it's a mass you know
when it's power to weight ratio can
match other stuff it replaces everything
because there's that hyper abundant
cheap fuel supply that lasts forever
that's when that does that but for
engines unless its power weight ratio on
that spaceship is that good you don't
replace it with that and for smaller
ones nuclear can be made pretty tiny
chemical can be made tiny um you can do
things like use compressed gas as your
push or for a lot of things too expect
to see all of the above in there but is
there a rule for fission um
borrowing that eventually that really
good fusion drive
that is compact and powerful then vision
would definitely keep playing the role
very much so even if it's because we're
using some fission of you know
transgenic elements we only can make it
ground side fusion reactors though too
bulky to move around
and i love ntrs for that purpose we will
see them more in use i think when we
have more industry up in orbit so that
we can do most the critical radioactive
and dangerous bits where they're not
going to come land on earth if something
goes wrong always a good side note yeah
because rockets explode a lot all right
we've been doing this for 50 some years
60 years of flying rockets up into space
and we don't lose too many but we you
know it's it's
it's not exactly something that happens
once a decade and that thing's got like
20 30 kilograms of uranium or plutonium
in it
that's a major incident right now
imagine you've scaled it up a thousand
forwards we're doing real space industry
now one's blowing up every month
you know you need to do a little bit
better than that
jw norton says what if an ai ran out of
memory or processing power
what if an ai ran out of memory or
processing power
um
i feel like there's something missing
from that question uh it needs to i mean
insert caffeine here uh let's
uh what happens to a human when they run
out of uh proceeding power they uh they
they you know take a nap yeah we take a
nap uh it cools down it it holds its
fans on high and then close a few
windows out
um
i mean it's it's people saying things we
have going on there with ourselves the
memory is probably the bigger one is
there a limit to how much memory oh how
much you can well here's the thing to
keep in mind um because you keep
plugging memory into something obviously
and say oh it's got more and more memory
uh well right but i can have access to
your library with a you know with the
old code catalog this still eliminates
how quickly i can retrieve books from
that thing that's going to be based on
its size and my ability to find things
in it and i could be the point of being
physical size so if you got to run down
the hallway to grab the contents of a
given book and back that puts a
practical limit on your memory you know
helen wong says what are your thoughts
about the metaverse and the criticism
and fears surrounding it
the metaphors
if someone wants to post up what that is
because i i the first thing in my head
would be something like the terry
pratchett metaphors multiverse thing
he's got going on there with narrative
causality um i don't i'm sorry i don't
recognize that one okay that's that's
struggling something off my head though
i seen recording something about that
being like the the end of big tech as a
news article recently but i'm not
picking on that one unfortunately
wynton ashley thank you for your super
chat do you think that we will ever
automate ourselves out of having science
as a job occupied by humans
um
friends what kind of thing we're
defining as human
your science always is getting done
principally by your your biggest
smartest group of people right uh it's
kind of a price loss thing that a lot of
you what gets done by
those folks that i was just knowing the
camera doesn't really seem to be
focusing on very well does it
well we'll do that on the commercial
break this does not have any commercials
in it um
oh my just reset on that question
would you like me to repeat the question
yeah probably will we ever automate
ourselves out of having science as a job
by humans okay so
with the very big notation going in
there that
all of our production of science tends
to be done by a relatively small chunk
of the very top so that if you're
increasing that new topics they're
getting that work done keep in mind that
everyone always thinks of robotics and
computers as replacing factory locals
and putting people out of work there and
of course that does go on too but what
was the first job replaced by computers
it was computers it was a job title for
people who computed for a living they
were the computers the harvard computers
are a great group of people to do a
little historical background on it
wonderful people helped us calculate all
sorts of great stuff and they went away
because of the thing we call computers
now if you look at what has been
replaced by um computers
by and large historically it's been
white cargo drops more than than
blue-collar jobs it's just we become so
much more productive and we have so much
more things requiring
administrative work and paper shuffling
you know that we just keep producing
more of those jobs
uh and then we automate them out um but
those the ones tend to go away a lot
faster a lot of you know industrial jobs
those move around a lot to be fair
though um but uh you know we have less
factories we used to so will we
eliminate the need for human scientists
um
probably but probably with the caveat
that you only do that because you have
something that's better than humans
doing that now that might be that might
be i don't think that's coming too soon
right but that might be your classic
trans human who's got brain
augmentations that might be people like
jumping up on nootropic drugs there
might be an artificial intelligence that
you've built specifically to analyze
astronomical data and just pulls them
out way better than we do but we don't
know about that yet but i'd say yes that
probably would be there based on human
disease though either we'll discover all
those are science and there will be a
finite limit to that this is not going
to be a a box in the box in the box
thing there is a finite amount of
science because there's a finite
universe as we say um you're going to
have that maxed out that might happen
beforehand so it might be that we just
run out of any need for scientists in
the next century or two
interesting thoughts so law of
improbability asks how would
megastructures compartmentalize against
accidents presumably
arcologies would also face a trade-off
between the efficiencies of common
infrastructure and redundancy
um
i would say
one of the problems we always have
really big complex things and there's
nothing kind of more complex than trying
to build an artificial ecology which is
kind of what you have in our you know
without ecology or space station
is that you really get limit on what you
can do with compartmentalization because
every i always leaks right so your
compartmentalizing in some ways against
different types of attack
um different vectors things in your
login like the systems you're using to
make sure that an artillery shell
hitting the side of your building or
your space station is not blowing
through all the other ones and leaking
the air out is not the same systems
you're really relying on the same
defense you're relying on to keep uh you
know bacteriological spreads to the the
arcology and that's a thing to remember
when everyone's recycling all their air
inside a big old building like with them
have blocks we're seeing the old
cyberpunk stuff which is a mega scraper
full of people and it looks like it's
been graffitied when it wasn't being
shot
those buildings are ugly and nasty and
they'd all be dead inside them very soon
because they show no signs of real air
recycling you know cleaning in which
case every time somebody gets a flu or
plague or anything it just would shoot
right through the building which makes
for some great dystopian fiction from a
realistic standpoint though what it
means is you've got like uv burners
inside the air vents and you're
scrubbing things through x y or z
hyperfilters and so forth and these are
each going to require their own
specialized oversight too so these are
the kind of things you're looking at is
what are the ways things can spread by
accident by nature by time erosion or by
direct sabotage and you you set up a
immune system response to that
right
and that's can sometimes overlap with
something do more than one function and
or does one as a secondary but for the
most part each one has its own thing
so we have a question from david risker
what are your thoughts on don't look up
i believe that's a book title or a movie
i don't know it
none at the moment i'm sorry okay
all right we have a little longer
question here from albert jackson uh
welcome back to the channel albert good
afternoon isaac technology exists today
to circumvent or lessen the impact of
various disabilities in your opinion
will the idea of disability disappear
eventually with advances in technology
um
i mean when we talk about concepts
themselves disappearing i would guess
probably not we change what would
qualify as disability a lot a width
shift in time um
sometimes because when identifying new
ones sometimes there's an amazon truck
pulling up next to my window
that's that strange beeping big bb
noise tail
advances in technology i mean now if you
can't get out to the store you can have
it delivered to you
exactly it's a wonderful thing
um
but uh wow that will just completely
clear your brain out what was albert
asking
if disabilities would disappear because
of technologies we are seeing a huge
impact on that i mean you think about
some of the circumstances that we've
seen more locally with some of the
folks that have lost limbs and the how
quickly that they're able to
actually get adaptive technology to
be able to walk or write or
there's a there's a variety of
advances that are not that are available
now that weren't available even 50 years
ago we have a friend i would say we're
trying to avoid saying their name or
where we know them from um on something
he gets watched by tens of thousands of
people but
one of our friends uh lost the use of
hull but she had to have amputated most
of one hand all of another hand and both
of her uh feeds
uh and uh they had already fitted for
prosthetic uh legs very soon there
afterwards less than two months later
and uh you know it is it's amazing how
quickly that progress has been made in
my own lifetime
and
we are going to see it into that kind of
process that is going to improve when we
get the point we can do you know
activated regrowth or cloning of
individual limbs or organs too as an
even better thing but that prosthetic
technology has been improving so much
you know cochlear implants i think those
were invented while i was alive at least
that's nice of their main usage for
hearing we are getting really close to
being able to do artificial eyes it
depends on what the artificial what the
damage is the eyeball
will that see the end of all
disabilities you do some vision
transplants yeah
i mean when my grandfather lost an eye
at six years old a hundred years ago
they just replaced it with a glass eye
now they have a lot of ability to
we've gotten a lot better reconnect and
fix some of those issues
we've gotten a lot better about novelty
connections on that too but there's a
lot of
work still to be done that unfortunately
too but it is definitely coming along
you know we'll get into we'll be able to
actually give people heat sensitivity
touch sensitivity in these organs vision
is high data transport so it's mostly
about connecting the uh the actual
artificial eye to the brain
but um these will improve will get rid
of all disabilities
we'd find new ones i think um you could
use the point they mean little things
can be a new disability in some kind of
context uh i joke sometimes that if we
uh you know people say why is there so
much pain in the universe and say if we
lived in the universe where the worst
thing that he ever got was like a
hangnail people would still be screaming
about that so we will find there always
something new to to improve but that's
as it should be you know someone says
that that's a weakness of some sort when
you toughen up well it doesn't want to
be tough but
when you have a problem with
insufficiency disability anything like
that seeking to be able to eradicate
them when they're small it's not a bad
thing at all that's that's that's what
we do we try to find these options and i
stress options because we're not telling
people they have to take these you know
because they might be sometimes they
don't want to some things they just
personally don't want to remove or just
they don't like the new treatment for it
these are options you know the goal is
to give people not a perfect cereal box
but the 50 different types of cereal you
can buy at 3 o'clock in the morning at
walmart you know that's the the goal
there so
i don't think there will be
an end to disabilities anytime soon but
i think we'll find that we just keep
getting better and better treatments for
more and more of them
so we have a super chat from horse the
great thank you
how long would a kuku blitz star drive
take me to get to alpha centauri uh that
entirely depends on the kugelblitz in
question assume that that one could
probably pull off a 1g acceleration for
its lifetime because again it depends on
it all a cougar blitz really is is a
black hole that's spinning out a ton of
radiation
uh and it's doing so at an efficiency
and conversion rate that is very close
to straight equals mc squared as a
result of that
you can get up to some very high speeds
you can get something that is truly
relativistic so a flight to alpha
centauri in under a decade is very much
on the table with a google blitz black
or starship and then for other ones
besides that
assume the distance in light yields cut
in half is your approximate flight time
approximate you might do better you
might do worse but there are a lot of
other problems traveling that got speed
too so
that's probably about the best you get
so space texan is asking if nuclear war
was imminent could we induce kessler
syndrome to prevent the use of icbm
missiles no icbms are one of the few
things that still work very well uh
during a castle syndrome most icbms are
following a suborbital path you know
they can fire them straight up straight
down as a wall or around they're only in
the air for
30 to 40 50 minutes whatever it is
depending on the flight time
um as they're going into a very short
drop
um castle syndrome is something that
rips stuff apart over the course of you
know
weeks months maybe as little as days or
hours if there's a extreme version of it
you know
and
at that point in time you would be a lot
better off just detonating nukes in high
orbit where those were flying by and
trying to get them that way uh think
about nuclear bombs they're very sturdy
in some ways because we usually make
them out of uranium because
it's a heavy metal for using for that
purpose as the blast
um but at the same time they are
incredibly fragile you know um
and then there's a film called broken
arrow it was one of the
ones with john travolta and i can't
remember his name
another actor
at one point in time toronto is the bad
guy thing and screaming at somebody
they've stolen some nuclear weapons
they're having a firefight near them the
guy stops shooting the nuclear bombs
and uh nuclear bomb and the thing about
those is you give yourself radiation
poisoning from breaching the one that's
got plutonium warhead though probably
not you're not going to accidentally set
one off that's just not how that works
it's not um you know it's not
nitroglycerin it takes extreme precision
to set one off so almost any damage to a
nuclear bomb that's not well designed
inside its actual threshold for flight
is going to disable that thing they are
they are anything but indestructible
raven609 thank you for your super chat
and uh he says if you ever run out of
video ideas you should start making
orion's arm lore videos
um you know of course video was kind of
an orion's own law video of that
megastructures episode which at the
bottom you can see the cover it does say
with steve bowers i mean i wrote thing
up but i used mostly it was almost
entirely his art for that him and a few
other folks um from ryan's arm and
because the contest that time was it
wasn't supposed to really be a science
video it was supposed to be a science
look at a lot of sci-fi concepts writers
could use in their work
uh because the time i i just i didn't
have any idea for a story i'd like to
write but i was enjoying working with
authors a lot
and going back to that first or second
question from today about writing a
sci-fi novel
and um i know i said you know
these are these beautiful ideas they'd
be great sources to be you know in a
story and you know one of the reasons
that i like a lion's arms to have so
many of those written up
lions on me that's kind of a shared uh
theme source for hard sci-fi
and um
i think that i could very easily do
quite a few of the concepts that were
there but there's always some really
great entries on there that might be a
fun thing to do at some point in time
see if the orion's all folks want me to
narrate them they could have their own
chair although i think though you know
it's uh there's a lot of good material
there and they're probably with much
better voices than mine just to narrate
that material but there's some amazing
content up there so i think this will be
the last video
i'm sorry go ahead i think this will be
the last question before the break it
kind of ties in with that same
art
concept
again from tkg wildfire thank you for
your super chat what designs will we see
from a space-faring human society like
art deco was implemented in train
designs for decades
one more time please
what designs will we see from a
space-faring human society
similar to how art deco was implemented
in train designs for decades
um you know there's a i've heard people
say things like uh you know rockets are
beautiful or you know planes are
gorgeous you know and i think that
people tend to forget that this is an
example of i think it may be called the
vitruvian school of extremist goal but
uh the idea that beauty follows um form
and function
um
they look pretty because they or they
look awesome because you know what they
do
um
and i think that where our space design
is concerned
we used to have all these like
ufo-shaped sci-fi spaceships or these
more rock you know things that look more
like either a straight-up rocket or they
look like a plate that was the old
design science fiction a lot of times
for what things in space would look like
one of the things i loved about the
movie alien the the original alien um
with sigourney weaver on it was that
picture of the nostromo the spaceship
their eyes it flies in the shot and
something we all see a little bit with
george lucas's star destroyers in the
original star wars film was we certainly
started seeing designs that were not
aerodynamic at all they were huge
monstrosities with antennas and stuff
sticking out of them because there's no
they're not going to land on a planet
they're never landing on a planet but
shuttle that does that they go through
space where there is no air resistance
and so
i don't know what we're going to see in
terms of light stylus from space but you
know
i don't think we see anything
streamlined coming out of that they
usually thought is in a space kind of
environment and a lot of the fishing you
see from the 60s and 70s we see the uh
the aluminum foil and streamline effect
on everything
and i don't think that's what we're
going to be seeing from those designs so
i think yet yes we will absolutely see
reflections of those designs hitting the
earth because
you know what goes on there will be the
cool new front the new fashion as it
were
you might see people wearing things that
look more like a spacesuit as we get
those a little bit more like something
you'd actually want to wear as a human
space suits our monstrosity the way
they're worse than battle normal which
is not comfortable
80 pounds of gear will make any day
horrible but i do think we'd see
reflections that down on our planet with
time because that's where the new
fashion the new cutting edge gonna be a
lot of times i wouldn't go ahead and go
to break i will back about three or four
minutes and take more of your questions
so we'll be on break for a few minutes
and it's a great time to get a drink and
a snack and get more questions into our
moderators for the second half of the
show
we never managed to get to every
question plus many folks miss the live
show and catch it on replay so i
encourage everyone to leave their
questions in the comments below where
myself or others often answer them one
that got asked after last month's show
was from salvitas who asks won't beaming
energy down to earth from orbital solar
generators increase the specific energy
of earth increasing the heat and average
temperatures is that going to be a
problem is that much different than
releasing potential energy stored in
things like hydrocarbons
this is a great question and one that
comes up in various forms in some of our
deep planning for the long distant
future and that's about the idea that
even an energy abundant society can only
get so many folks on your planet before
the energy turns into heat would get too
high in the short term energy beaming as
a replacement for earth side power
generation represents no heat problem
but in the very long term it can be
now this is a problem even with really
good fusion reactors or black hole
generators because they still make heat
and most the energy they produce comes
out as heat not electricity possible
solutions include blocking the
non-visible infrared light from the sun
which is much of it or erecting enormous
space towers to serve as heat radiators
something we call force when we looked
at it in matrioska ward some years back
in their nivens ring ward one species
even moved their planet further from the
sun
however one thing that tends to get
overlooked is that whether you're
collecting solar power in space or
simply building your reactors up there
the microwaves you beam down get convert
to electricity at about 85 percent
efficiency with about 15 turning to heat
during the reconversion on the ground
and maybe as low as 10 percent
alternatively any heat engine on the
ground is lucky to have even half its
energy coming out as electricity rather
than heat similar problems exist for
solar panels
so in this context energy beaming or
even running down superconductors from
huge space towers is letting you get
more electricity usefully in play on a
planet poor the amount of heat added all
that energy ends up as heat eventually
mind you but anything that is turned to
heat before you get to use it as
electricity even once is at best getting
maybe a partial recycle going up a space
tower configured as a seabeck effect
thermopile and 10 heat to electricity is
about the best those might realistically
recover as a result we might eventually
end up doing orbital power generation
and beaming it even if we came up with a
super cheap fusion reactor tomorrow
simply because we didn't want any of the
heat generation occurring on planet
where the heat of conversion of
microwaves to electricity via rectena is
again very low as we'll be running down
superconductors from orbital
infrastructure all at the same time we
may use a lot of shades and mirrors to
minimize sunlight coming into earth
especially those frequencies that have
little use to life either for
photosynthesis or vision
every planet will have a heat budget
based on how much energy it is creating
locally or absorbing and its rate of
heat emission and might also need
reservoirs for handling temporary
overproduction
this is also true of space habitats and
is quite likely the method of aggressive
diplomacy or embargo for the future
would be turning heat on a planet or
megastructure to slowly raise its
temperature until folks gave in
as a quick announcement before we get
back to the show as i mentioned at the
end of this thursday's episode the rand
corporation is hosting a conference on
march 7th and 8th on the future of space
cooperation between the us and japan in
santa monica and i will be giving the
closing remarks on the second day and
david kipping from cool awards is
keynotey on day one
and there will be plenty of other great
presenters in between if you'd like to
join in personal or online i'll attach
the link for registration in the episode
description it will actually be my first
in-person presentation i've done since
covet hit and also my first time back in
my birth state of california since i was
two and since it's been a particularly
cold winter here in northeast ohio this
year i'm looking forward to seeing santa
monica in march
alright with all that said let's get
back to the show and more of your
questions
[Music]
everybody behind sorry
yeah
wait i suppose it would help if i
actually used some microphone sorry
my
i got a little distracted because i got
put my coffee came back and i saw the
the play on the the screen of what was
the the livestream mid break and it was
that earlier question about energy
uh put the uh specific energy for earth
so sometimes when the about halfway
through the month i'll decide to prep
all the slides everything for the live
stream and that midway break and uh i
have been sometimes taking questions
from then i'll just write up something
record it and
then i kind of forget it until the
actual day of the event so
let me answer that question twice today
whoops
all right well they should feel well
loved and well blessed and we're moving
on to bear 666 with a question about
what mechanisms could facilitate a
sentient hive mind outside of telepathy
pheromones or some type of brain chip
interface
besides telepathy well
um i mean if you want to think of our
own neurons as an example we use just a
direct neurochemical or synaptic
connection that's not removed from the
table especially because you might have
something like
imagine you had a neuroconnective moss
that was basically a substrate for
passing information around and all the
creatures that walked across that were
kind of like plugged into the local
wi-fi good as it were of that moss even
though it was by electrochemical you
know reception
there's also a speed aspect of this
things don't have to be at a very quick
rate it might be where every time they
stand still for one minute the
connections reestablished and they
update so things don't have to move too
quickly uh you could even theoretically
have something weird like uh
semiconductors or superconductors built
into the actual structural plant you
know it's crystals for instance or
even ice you could potentially have four
pathways melted through there's that
great example from aleister reynolds
short story glacial where uh
the uh you know they're studying these
warms and uh you know it's not the worms
they're actually causing you know some
kind of higher intelligence to be there
it's rather the little tunnels they cut
through a glacial they're forming an
actual computer of that glacier and
that's really a wonderful short story
that i just spoiled for it right there
that's that's not the most important
part though i'd still recommend that
that's my favorite character at two from
his series neal complain so oh sorry
neville colvin i feel a character or
vespers name
gero afasano thank you for your super
chat he says hi guys isaac do you know
how a black hole can be more massive
than another if they all technically
have infinite math thank you and best
regards well they don't have infinite
mass theoretically they have infinite
mass density um as far as they be
compressed into a point like object we
don't know they actually get compressed
into a point like object by the way
that's that's an assumption we made for
a long time that is very debated and we
just don't have the
we don't have enough knowledge of
quantum gravity scale stuff to say what
happens
um
a lot of us tend to doubt whether you
think we can breastfeed plank density
for instance which is
you know where you can squeeze a whole
universe and some of these sizes are cut
but still infinite you know anything
anything finite compared to infinity is
still
tiny and small
um
black holes though have different mass
what happens all being compressed into a
very tiny area and that caused them to
seem like they would have uh you know an
infinite density however like they're
event horizon that's entirely based on
the mass then it's linear
in radius to that mass which has the
interesting effect that if you double
the mass of a black hole you are cubing
the volume inside that real black or the
event horizon and you are quadrupling
the surface area of that event horizon
so it has interesting effects that we
care a lot about when we're talking
about ways to use black holes for
hawking radiation drives or for building
giant birch planets out of
yes
so wiley bergeron
hi isaac what are your thoughts on
science fiction and video games do you
feel like any of them do the genre
justice and do you have a favorite
um
the episode i just got done wookie on it
spends a lot of time talking about mass
effect that's our synthetic life
episode uh for next sci-fi sunday and a
couple weeks ago so that one's kind of
dominating my mind but there's some
great ones out there uh channel
favorites uh space engine of course um
you've got uh well since we're solar
empires when i enjoy it quite a lot
um stellaris obviously i did a mod for
that one actually that's got my voice in
there for the computer that was fun to
do um the real isaac a.i
galactic civilizations uh two and three
uh mutu um
it was actually masters of orion two and
three
um
and uh there's just a whole host of them
i liked
the original dune 2000 uh well sorry the
original
dune two version 2000 i love that game
that was a great game obviously the
start for the real-time strategies genre
so stormland says how long would it take
us to build a dyson sphere or swarm
potentially as little as 30 years um it
depends on what you're at what you're
building towards and and
what you've got to build with you have a
lot of power to work with right uh let's
say that hypothetically we are just
trying to run global star with a thin
sheet of statites right or
solar mirrors basically uh to do a
chicago thruster how quickly can you do
that
well how quickly does it take to make a
sheet of tin foil
the size of a dyson sphere that's
basically what you're getting at in
terms of mass production and that comes
down to asking what the mass that is
what the output of that star is probably
lowering it by an order of magnitude to
take into account although
inefficiencies and travel times and
that's probably what it is so
you figure out how much aluminum someone
could extract from a solar system to
make that what the mass would be or
something to say one micron thick what
the surface area of a dyson sphere would
be at whatever distance you're putting
them at which might be like a tenth of
an au
and you run the numbers and you'll
probably get something less than a year
in a case that symbol now for something
more like a full-on
um you know full of rotating habitats
and all that that we usually envision
here or something like a matriarchal
brain where you need a lot more delicate
components
um that's probably going to take you
centuries if not millennia it just
depends what you're aiming to do and if
you're in a hurry
hi isaac and sarah i have a question
about artificial intelligence why would
you create a human level or greater ai
rom dan
um there's actually very little reason
to create a human level ai um because we
already have a bunch of them you know we
they're not a shortage of them there is
no short supply of humans and i don't
know anyone who i mean
uh some of the folks specifically in the
unimainic uh media that believes that
the main purpose of our efforts should
be to make life as pleasant for humans
as possible
um
we'll argue that we should be trying to
replace humans in any kind of world
capacity um
however
and that would presumably even include
creative efforts in a lot of cases
because then you're not reliant on any
other human for your creativity even
though you can go do your own
um i don't agree with that myself uh
though i understand the reason behind it
it's not like it's a horrible idea
compared to some other ones i thought um
however outside the context we have a
surplus of humans in our civilizations
highly animated we arguably already do
um in terms of keeping them preoccupied
um we have plenty of work for folks do
at the moment for instance but we ought
to have problems finding anybody wants
to fill it other times we haven't gotten
a fork to go around but by and large we
have not had problems finding new things
for people to do
uh strong ai things smaller than human
and and you know that's a new bracket we
don't have anything filling that right
now those are valuable because they're
the ones that say
you know let's say somebody who has an
iq 10 points higher uh than his fellow
scientists is the person who's doing you
know half the new breakthroughs you know
um your ones that really turned out
under something like price's law which
i'd recommend i would just wikipedia up
because i'll probably you but i answered
and i'd give them outside my head during
the little question
um
that person is producing a lot of
science if you make an ai or a trans
human uses ten percent smarter or ten iq
points higher they might suddenly turn
out you know entire generations with to
be effort in their lifetime than the few
peers
um in which case those folks are
replaced
uh and again that's probably where ai
would be most useful to us in that area
those things we can't do the other thing
is a lot of times it's not about trying
to get generalized intelligence to this
smaller person it's about making a
specialized intelligence the smarter
person the intelligence that's able to
do something that we don't even really
want to do like simultaneously track
every airplane going over the country to
make sure that they all are you know
being informed of everything they need
to know to fly safely you know that's
the sort of thing that a computer is
just perfect for especially ai that's
designed around that goal so don't
assume that an ai that's smaller than
people at something like even like
something like science or music
composition would actually be something
you'd have a conversation with and think
was wow that guy's smart you might think
jesus this ai is a drooling idiot
but they're brilliant at that particular
thing that's probably more likely to be
a case in a lot of cases too for what we
want to design
um
but by and large the area near human
it only only has the value of good
communication and reality based on
modern chat bots i'm betting you don't
need anything even close to his
intelligence human to be able to pull
off a conversation most people find
satisfactory for entertainment purposes
and other than that
there are eight billion of us right now
or close to eight billion of us it
shouldn't be that hard to find a good
conversational opponent it's meet your
taste so
mr super says what are your thoughts on
nasa's luna gateway's design is it what
we need now or should it be bigger
um
oh that's a hard one
um you're asking me if it should be
bigger and the answer course is always
yes
please um i i i love you boulder better
says isaac arthur it works better if
brute force doesn't get the job done
you're not using enough of it um
almost all of our problems with dealing
with space right now come from the fact
that we're trying to build things though
super light
and and minimal right because you know
why spend another 30 billion dollars to
have extra shielding on a spaceship to
get the moon is kind of the idea um i
liked the big steps forward because it
streamlines out so many problems um
however that we're not there yet we'd
actually access some place like the moon
to get a lot of raw materials that we'd
have to fly through heavy rocket ships
to get there uh the falcon heavy might
do a lot of that force too you know
these new designs make that a lot
cheaper and more viable
i think the lunar gateway is worth
building i know i would love to see a
scaled up
version but i'll take it i'll take it as
it is you know that would do the job for
me just fine so tyrion is new here
welcome tyrion do you guys think that
photonic computers
will be a viable addition to quantum
computing
um
[Music]
well let me start by saying that i am
not an expert on either quantum
computers or obviously optronics um
and
i can't answer
you
the newbie stumped him
there's potential there but not enough
for me to tell you if that's like the
big next step on quantum computing no i
can't tell you that i'm not sure there
really are a lot of big next steps on
quantum beauty i
it's got its value quantum computers
definitely has the most value we did an
episode on it people over hyped the heck
out of quantum compute a lot of times
too so i tend to poo poo it myself just
because it gets so much over hype it's
got its value
so randy smith says how would a heavy
earth achieve space travel at what mass
would the surface gravity prevent a
spacecraft from achieving orbit using
chemical rockets
um you know when we did the super wealth
episode recently we kind of looked at
that question a bit more and what you
see there is that basically you're not
going to find a planet that would
actually have a surface you could really
live on uh even if they were you know
quite the super skeletal mutant um if
you get above two surface gravities and
from a practical standpoint that means
that you're not going to get an escape
velocity of that planet on orbital
velocity more than double what we got
here right
uh we stepped through the individual
math there that episode the show learned
how to do that it's not just a perfect
scale up you get that with that with a
rocket that's the stuff we said tomorrow
which has those kind of velocities in
them
is it harder yes it is is it doable
absolutely but the other thing remember
is we have a lot of things that are not
dependent on on that equation to get
into space all those launch loops and
things we discussed on the show those
are not new ideas some of them are but
like the basic launch loop those rail
cans those predate rocketry is a concept
the technology is there if you want to
do it and on a planet with more thicker
atmosphere for instance it gets a lot
easier to start doing buoyancy to hold
up heavy metals right you get new
options that i wouldn't say cancel out
the difficulty but make some of that
they give you a little bit better odds
so i don't think there is a maximum
gravity for a planet that we really call
a inhabited planet in that regard
borrowing obviously all artificial ones
we discussed like
giant shovels built around black holes
that you're not getting off those
chemical rocket
moth tucker hey isaac have you seen the
expanse i've only watched a bit so far
but i was curious to hear your thoughts
on the scientific realism portrayed in
the series specifically on the gravity
on the ship
all right um i have not seen season five
all the way through for the expansion
and i don't know if there was a season
six i also haven't read anything past
book i can't was book four book five
um and uh i kind of try to stop about
the same place i know the devotee and
plot a little bit i like the book more
and i like the tv show but the tv show
is great it's got some good casting
which is always nice but i think i was
actually using as a point recently in in
one of our episodes was that there is
such a difference between you know the
the jim horton of the tv show was the
jim horton of the books uh science wise
i give them a lot of points um the two
authors of that uh of that book series
and then the whoever's been doing the
screenplay on it have kept pretty good
scientific realism where they can for a
sci-fi show it's way better than star
trek for instance i i've never been
quite clear why star trek always had the
reputation the sciencey brainy show and
star wars the completely fantasy show
because they both have all sorts of
crazy made-up science that doesn't exist
in them uh worse than doctor who in some
cases which is not the one that's who
cares about science um but
um they do mess some things up that are
kind of critical to me the core plot
lines uh for instance there's water on
air shortages on in the asteroid belt
and they have the epstein drive the fc
drive is this cheap fusion reactor
that's like your ideal fusion torch
um there is no energy uh
deficit in such a system
if you can burn things at one g for
you know hours and hours at a time to
move ice for the ecosystem into the
asteroid belt then that means that you
have megawatts of energy or power
available per person there is no air
water no shortages or things like that
in there so the entire state conflict
that we see in that series is
but it's beautifully written hokum
and uh they do a much better job with
mostly other science besides that like
the uh the ecology aspects that we see
on i can't which moon of jupo's it was
um that they have the
with the biologists what we see in
season two of booktube um
that is done wonderfully about how the
ecology broke down their in their
habitats there um there's some great
stuff in there and it is a great series
the one me bridge mc
something very long and complicated
meeper mcmeep maybe
if a fusion
reactor is more efficient the bigger it
is with a smaller reactor on a torpedo
that can accelerate for 15 g's for about
20 seconds sound semi-realistic
i don't know if we can't actually
already do that with a normal or
chemical rock yet um i'm not sure why
you at that point throw the fusion
reaction in there um
this is an issue that we have a lot of
times in science fiction it's based on
the drives available people always
wonder why things are moving around
faster like you would have big bulky
carrier ships uh the problem is that all
these things moving around and darting
around very fast that seemed like they'd
be great for automation with robot and
some drones and torpedoes
don't actually work very well inside the
available known physics because they
tend to forget you run out of fuel real
quick when you're doing things like that
um
nuclear energy fusion or fission is
non-optimal
right non-optimal for things to
accelerate briefly and quickly you'll
probably do better with chemical rockets
they are or with
nuclear fission chain reactions also
known as h-bombs
so
if you're if your torpedoes be propelled
by h-bombs um
then potentially yes and uh then so if
you want to have the kind of high speed
replacement for chemical either using
some kind of very dense electric battery
extremely dense electric battery that's
discharging ions out at incredible rates
or more likely
just use antimatter antimatter is your
ultimate chemical fuel source as it will
okay
felix d welcome back he says hello
everyone dude chemical fuel substitute
let's continue selling felix d says
hello everyone could ai act as
ambassadors and reflect resolve
conflicts
what do we mean by ai is always that big
question um think about the alien and
bastrop because i mean obviously would
say alien we're talking about
extraterrestrials but that's a term that
goes back for that even dealing with
like human alien situations of our
neighbors just our diplomatic neighbors
and there's one that's obviously on
everyone's mind right now diplomacy wise
we could send an alien ambassador to
another planet and what we would
probably do instead is create from the
ground flow up an actual
ai that was designed with that in mind
what's the perfect ambassador or someone
who's still loyal to their own country
but completely understands the peoples
that he's going to speak to you know is
heavily immersed in them with an
artificial intelligence building a
person
can be the ambassador or who has a kind
of a mixed human
robot alien psychology going on that's
designed with the intent of allowing
them to perfectly understand human
interactions
and culture and background while at the
same time remembering the influences and
needs of their background or even one
for it so someone might say taking that
to an extreme as a war could we use it
for something a lot closer to home which
is you know our own diplomatic
interactions with our neighbors and the
answer is probably yes
don't assume though that an ai would
ever be neutral i do not know why in
science fiction we always see this
assumption that computers are going to
be fair and neutral and logical and so
these things were synonymous which they
are not either i would never trust an
artificial intelligence to be any less
you know biased than the humans they're
not just the humans that programmed
either just that's that's how that works
that's that's a good flow into the next
question from eccentricity you typically
discuss future humans not too
differently from modern ones what do you
think about significant technological
augmentation that could make our
descendants unrecognizable
um i guess it kind of depends what's
been unrecognized for being mentally or
physically you know if it
which is more human a human who's got a
huge mind augmentation inside them to
the point that they're they're very
alien in psychology or someone who's got
no human brain on them but is running
around on like a centaur chassis you
know the human center
um and that's not a you know that is
that's not a rhetorical question um i
don't know what the answer actually
would be a lot of these cases because it
depends on what you mean and that's a
little bit subjective um
on the show we always talk about a
future humanity that's recognizable to
us because
that is the the kind of plot device of
the tales inside the of the episodes to
let people actually see and envision
this do i think in the 25th century the
typical humans could be like the human
from nowadays yeah
um we're not really all that much like
the people from the 16th century either
truth be told there's a lot of
similarities because we haven't got
major augmentation but don't think that
your psychology is really all that
similar your word for you is very
similar to theirs and we start throwing
in cybernetics augmentation genetics
things like that yeah those are going to
shift things around a lot i don't know
what a human looks like
come the 30th millennia in terms of
psychology behavior whatever it is
you'll see our episode on super powers
or cyborgs for some of the more extreme
stuff that could potentially happen with
that mentally physically et cetera uh or
episode smart matter at the end of this
month because we talk about that too not
this month mulch
but uh i don't really expect the average
typical human of you know millennia from
now to really be that much like thus for
now but i would expect it to be just to
still exist right i would think there'd
still be humans who are as we will say
natural so to speak of nowadays still
around then i think we simply see a big
divergence once around you know
remember when we talk about something
like evolution we say well things are
much more complicated than the simple
life back at the beginning of things um
they were all descended from that
theoretical amoeba as a war remember
that most life on this planet by both
mass and certainly by quantity is
single-celled you know simple organisms
so don't assume that the future
necessarily means there's no simple
regular humans around either
ishmael arc says if hawking radiation
was proven
would that mean we could retrieve
information lost in a black hole or
would spaghettification make anything
that fell into one unrecognizable
um well hockey radiation is is hard to
prove in the first place unless you're
actually making them up in a lab because
all the naturally occurring ones you
need to get dangerously close to one
that you have a chance with really
sensitive equipment of picking it up
remember your typical hockey radiation
off these things from a normal black
hole is designed to radiate out of like
10 to the 60th years which is a trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillion
years in the future
um even for something that's got the
massive star that's a very low power
output
that's in that range where you probably
would need to have our finest most
sensitive equipment right next to it to
pick that up
uh now the ones you might make in the
actual lab they're only megatons or
gigatons of black hole you can pick
those up and that'll probably be how you
actually prove that hawking radiation
existed um otherwise you gotta make a
trip for about a thousand light years to
get the newest one and then build some
incredibly good apparatus hoping to pick
it up
what you probably mean though is the
accretion energy of the stuff as it
falls into the black hole and that'll
cause a lot of noise realistically
i don't think that you would ever be
able to block that up enough to be able
to recover signals near there uh there's
always be some kind of accretion disk
especially as we get near this week some
junk from us even our exhaust from our
spaceship as we drew new is going to
form an accretion disk around it
um i
would say that in terms of the concept
of like the firewall with black holes
that information thing that one's still
being debated and i don't think anyone's
in my mind conclusively won it yet so
that's during the theory side and we
might have to wait to test that out
okay so we're coming up to five o'clock
the question for you is do you want to
uh answer a few more questions
try a lightning round uh
like a five minute lightning round
five-minute lightning round see if i can
actually pull it off can you can you try
like 30-second answers
oh that's really lightning that's good
okay well if you want to do shorter than
that we have about 10 or 15 questions
left in the queue well let's just file
through at least 10 of them all right
the tardigrade will our society and
government institutions be able to
withstand or adapt to the exponential
progress of technology and the
transformation of everything from the
economy to our sense of self
no no every government basically is a
temporary hoarding pattern to be
replaced by the next generation that
understands it better and overthrows it
eccentricity what fundamental
technologies will need the most
development to make mars colonization
successful
uh carbon dioxide filtration be a big
one and uh really something that's able
to withstand uv radiation a lot better
will probably be another one that we
really make progress on
oh and hydrogen storage
valdarg there are many currently hooked
up to an artificial lungs ecmo machine
and those using artificial hearts or
dialysis for kidneys could all of these
be put together to start a brain in a
jar
probably i think in case of a brain gel
though you'd actually have to be feeding
it as that basic nutrient oxygen and
sugar i i'd be that wonderful animation
that jeremy joswick did that i like to
use that shows that probably just sugar
oxygen and some other nutrients
okay harkinan wants to know how would a
future civilization go about defending
itself from a gamma ray burst
uh i think in the episode with joe scott
that we did looking at five ways to walk
it in how we could stop it we suggested
putting up a big thin shield like a big
thing of tin foil about you know one
millimeter across and the size of a
planet so one small asteroid's worth in
between us and that star we start going
that phase and just kind of holding it
there
another super chat from tkg wildfire
thank you tkg
match effect drives appear to bypass the
requirement of propellant by altering
mass and altering by altering energy
what would the effects of drives that
bypass the rocket equation you see mass
effect or mock effect
mock okay
um what's the question again
can they bypass propellant by bypassing
by alternating mass by alternating if
they look as people say they do things
like a pitch drive or a differential
drive um there's a few of these that are
kind of suggested hypothetically to
exist then yes those those actually have
the potential to do that but i don't
expect them to be able to violate that
quick addendum to the previous one you
wouldn't leave a big shield there you
probably have
something you could inflate with an
explosion like an h-bomb that would blow
the shield up so that you're not got big
things just hanging the sky all the time
you have many of them and just tornado
like it's needed
continuing by haddock keen hey isaac i
want to thank you for producing the best
futuristic content on the internet it
has inspired me to start reading sci-fi
and start world building to my own
universe awesome i want to thank you for
just giving me a compliment as opposed
to a question because it can give you a
plain chance to cool down that's how
dance doesn't look like that so next
month we start seeing the smoke come out
of isaac's beers we'll know that
that the
lightning round is over
for everybody who does like writing
there are a lot of good sci-fi forms but
uh there are a lot of people in our
facebook group signs and features with
ice golothal which is linked to the
episode description that love to kick
these ideas back and forth and uh you
might have might like to join just talk
to some of them about this stuff too
cozy hi thank you for your super chat
hey isaac why hasn't any country
invested in a rocket sled launch they
reduce rocket costs massively and only
use existing tech thank you love the
content thank you very much um i would
say mostly because it requires a start
from a new level of architecture down
most countries are assuming that one of
the the big groups you know which really
you know that's the us
russia and maybe the eu or jackson that
really do all that major research for
that dot the eu the esa um and uh yes uh
and
[Music]
nobody really wants to go and build one
of those things the ground floor up they
haven't really got the folks because
most you're most skilled researchers
that kind of thing are already with one
of those top agencies because that's
where they went to be able to satisfy
their curiosity not to mention loan the
trade better and most of those groups
are not really want to invest that per
se i would say we probably would be
looking at right now if it hadn't been
for the success we've had with reusable
rockets in the last decade
a super chat from wynton ashley thank
you wynton what do you think are the
biggest human barriers to having
interplanetary travel for the untrained
or mentally unscreened masses such as
onset of various psychosis and transit
ignorance causing major issues and space
sickness etc we have the advantage that
we're not going to actually need to use
untrained personnel from that until
we've you know got the point we're
moving thousands and thousands of people
around at that which means we're doing
at economic prices at that point in time
it's like a cruise ship you have some
people that just weren't suited for it
period but by and large most people be
able to acclimate to it fairly quickly
and more to the point we wouldn't try to
make them acclimate to it across the
board we would do what we always do
which is try to make that hostile
environment more acclimated to us
all right blair brazda thank you for
your super chat as far as i understand
it time exists because matter exists
what will happen when all matter
converts into light will space-time stop
existing and the universe stop existing
thank you
those that's a couple different theories
there that are not proven mixed together
on that one we do not know that time
exists only because the matter exists
that that is speculative we do not know
what time really is this point time to
say that truth be told we don't really
know what matter is at this point in
time not to be able to speculate on that
connection we know that space and time
are inextricably leaked together as
essentially just one extra axis and that
does work with mass energy as a factor
in that
as the idea that everything would
convert into light at some point
um
yeah kind of maybe sort of technically
most of it will end up that way at some
point in time as photons especially if
we think it was like the the black hole
heat death or iron stars heat that the
universe but those things still have
mass and there's important things that
um energy is not
you know
uh
mass is not energy is not unique to
matter right all the gravity we have
from things that can be done just by
energy photons still have a
gravitational effect so don't assume
that all those things change around just
because it's not in a physical complex
normal battle state of protons neutrons
all right we're going to end with two
questions from when vincent walden
rivera i'm going to ask them one at a
time when will humans be able to obtain
interstellar space travel
um pete warden uh from sprague
strongshot initiative uh
and i would say also myself both on the
kind of loose agreement that
he's gonna be talking i'm talking at
next week so he comes to mind
anytime we feel like building a gigantic
solar array to power a laser to push
something up to high speed
we get so as a pro we get down for
centaurian century so we got that tech
now
so whenever we feel like we need to get
moving on that that's gonna be expensive
that's not something you do easy
especially you should probably talk
about you set a program that's at least
a couple tons to give a chance of
surviving the trip intact and
functioning and you know transfer stuff
back to us so
that's that's when do we feel like
spending a couple trillion dollars
probably that kind of zone
well we're gonna wrap up this uh
lightning round and live stream with one
last question before the isaac computer
starts melting down and having smoke
come out of these ears will it ever be
possible for technology to create
superhumans similar to the marvel movies
uh yeah
um but with with limitations they have
to work inside their zone of known
physics uh actually see our episode god
like aliens that's the first one from
may
uh for more details next i was actually
using that specific analogy
for defining them i think in many ways
we'll find that the reality that's
painted is probably both more and less
than we see with the comic books so but
then of course there's the entire
virtual reality of these things you'll
within the century be able to go live
and play as one in a computer if you
want to and that's probably a good place
to live off for the day the lighting
around is intensive yeah yes so if you
like the lightning round and you want it
to stick around drop a comment in the
chat below because
uh maybe we can end the with a
five-minute lightning round in the
future
if we get enough fan support
there's no questions see if i can answer
the same thing i'll just go ahead and
say to every question asked in the last
10 minutes of that lightning round great
assault on every answer in case i said
something incredibly stupid and wrong
while i was doing that
so we will see you guys next uh next
thursday have a good afternoon and uh a
good week
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook reddit
discord or our website isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
thursday
[Music]
