Hubble just gave us a close look at a recent
but very distant LFBOT, or Luminous Fast Blue
Optical Transient, incredibly bright flashes
of light visible millions if not billions
of light years away.
The first one was seen in 2018 and was nicknamed
the Cow, which was 10-100 times brighter than
your typical supernovae, but shorter lasting
and peaking in the blue range of light.
The Zwicky Transient Facility has helped us
find half-a-dozen since then, but their cause
remains a mystery.
Two large stars colliding is one theory, along
with failed supernovae or strange core-collapses
in a supernovae.
Another is that they might be cases of Kilonova,
when a pair of neutrons stars merge or one
merges with a black hole, or perhaps a white
dwarf passing near a black hole and being
disrupted.
What’s surprising about this new one though,
dubbed the Finch, is that it doesn’t appear
to be inside any galaxy, which might tilt
the evidence toward these being ejected Intermediate
Mass Black Holes chewing on a star they passed
by.
