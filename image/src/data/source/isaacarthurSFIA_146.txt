Will Humans In Space Be Taller?
It’s popular in science fiction  
to suggest people who live on planets with 
higher gravity than earth would be shorter  
or stouter, while those living on low 
gravity places like the Moon or Mars,  
or in the microgravity environment of 
space itself, might be tall and thin. 
There is little reason to think people would 
need to be taller in such an environment,  
especially as it’s easier to climb or jump up to 
grab something high in low-gravity, though many  
other variables might make extra height a benefit 
or disadvantage. However, low gravity means less  
need for thick, dense skeletons, so you might 
see skinnier people and those with more hand-like  
feet and skinnier legs. See our episodes Life on a 
Low-Gravity Planet and Zero Gravity Civilizations  
for more discussion of how people and life 
in general might adapt to these environments.
