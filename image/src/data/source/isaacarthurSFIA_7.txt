Mass Drivers and launch catapults are popular 
methods suggested of getting into space more  
cheaply by circumventing the rocket equation, but 
they’re even more handy on places like the Moon  
where the lack of atmosphere and low gravity make 
them easy to construct as a simple maglev rail  
across the lunar surface that accelerates the 
launch vehicle up to escape velocity, or even  
beyond that if desired. This allows a single pound 
of material to be launched for an energy cost  
parallel to a kilowatt-hour or a person for the 
modern equivalent of a few dollars of electricity,  
and using only modern technology. In this way 
raw materials or simple to manufacture items like  
bulky ship plating or fuel can be launched from 
lunar industries and save huge amounts of energy,  
fuel, and cost over getting the materials from 
Earth. For this reason, the Moon is often seen  
as the gateway to the rest of the solar system, 
able to help us build the ships and facilities  
to reach other planets, or even to launch cargo 
or crew directly from the Moon to other worlds.
