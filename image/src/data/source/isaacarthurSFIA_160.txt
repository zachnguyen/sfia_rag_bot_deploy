Aliens Beyond the Galactic Rim
 
About 5 years back there were studies 
showing how rare phosphorus is in the cosmos,  
and of the 6 keys elements making up 1% or more 
of you or I or other organisms on this planet,  
it’s the only one found in tiny quantities 
and appeared as a possible bottleneck on  
what planets might harbor life, a possible filter 
for the Fermi Paradox. We also believed that many  
regions of the galaxy might be low in Phosphorus 
and potentially devoid of life, especially older  
regions like the galactic rim, and that life 
would not plausibly occur at more than twice  
the distance Earth is from the Galactic Core.
But an article in Science News earlier this  
week reports a team of astronomers from 
Arizona having detected relatively large  
amounts of phosphorus in a vast gas cloud 3 
times as far from the core as we are. I’ll  
link that article in the description, and you 
can also check out our episode Fermi Paradox,  
the Phosphorus Problem, for more details, 
but it highlights that seeming paradox,  
in universe so huge, ancient, and seemingly 
friendly for life – where is it all?
