Nuclear fuel contains millions of times more
energy than the chemical fuels rockets use,
and seem ideal for faster space travel, but
they must transfer that energy to propellants
and the maximum speed of that ship is controlled
by that propellant temperature and momentum
out of the back.
Rocket nozzles and other equipment will begin
melting as their temperature rises, so we
either must use slow propellant, slow accelerating
ion drives, or find a way to move energy from
our reactor to that gas propellant better.
The lightbulb is at 40,000 degrees fahrenheit,
or 22,000 Celsius, where most of its light
is ultraviolet and which quartz is transparent
too.
That ultraviolet can pass outside without
warming that chamber as much, strike a propellant
particle, and transfer its momentum, which
then leaves the rocket at high speeds.
This is believed to be a safe and efficient
engine design able to achieve 3-6 times the
speed of our best chemical rockets.
See our episode the Nuclear Option for more
discussion of Nuclear powered spacecraft.
