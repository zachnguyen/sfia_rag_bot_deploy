As we explore the Universe seeking 
after signs of life or intelligence,  
what we call biosignatures or technosignatures, 
we seem to keep coming up empty. And while life  
need not be too rare for us not to be able to spot 
basic signs of biological life on distant planets,  
the absence of techno signatures is 
more worrisome. As the absence indicates  
technologically advanced life is either very rare 
or for some reason is not prone to expanding out  
into the galaxy. This is the crux of the Fermi 
Paradox, and yet many suggest life might be  
prone to wiping itself out instead of colonizing 
the galaxy. If so, these extinction events that  
wipe out worlds may also be visible, whether it’s 
an impact of an asteroid like we think killed the  
dinosaurs or signs of an extreme nuclear war, or 
some other doomsday device. These necrosignatures,  
astronomically visible death spasms 
of whole worlds, may be detected too,  
and if so, would paint a grim image of a dark 
and hostile galaxy we may be venturing into.
