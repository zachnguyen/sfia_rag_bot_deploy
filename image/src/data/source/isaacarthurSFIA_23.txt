The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket 
(VASIMR) is an advanced type of space propulsion  
technology under development that uses plasma, 
a hot, ionized gas, as its thrust medium. Unlike  
conventional chemical rockets, VASIMR utilizes 
radio waves to heat plasma to extreme temperatures  
and magnetic fields to channel this hot plasma 
out of the back of the engine, creating thrust,  
while avoiding the temperature limits on rocket 
engines that limits their specific impulse,  
or essentially the maximum speed they 
can reach with their available fuel or  
propellant. It would be slow to accelerate 
but able to reach higher maximum speeds,  
potentially in excess of 120,000 
miles per hour, or 0.02% light speed. 
One of the standout features of VASIMR is its 
ability to adjust the exhaust velocity of the  
plasma, which allows it to vary its specific 
impulse or thrust efficiency. This adaptability  
makes it potentially useful for a variety of 
missions, from fast transits between planets,  
Mars in just a couple months, to maintaining 
satellite orbits with high fuel efficiency.
