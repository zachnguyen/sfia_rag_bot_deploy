Non-Equatorial Space Elevators
One of our biggest goals in space  
development is to make space travel affordable to 
everyone. That’s where devices like Orbital Rings,  
Tethered Rings, Space Towers, Launch Loops, and 
Mass Drivers come in, and perhaps the best known  
of these megastructures is the Space Elevator, 
an enormously strong tether reaching from some  
spot on the equator to geostationary orbit or 
beyond, tens of thousands of miles above Earth. 
A major hurdle to building these is finding a 
material strong enough, but the other problem  
is that tether must be at the equator to avoid 
it whipping around, and few major cities are  
on the equator, but we would like to be able 
to leave directly from those places. However,  
we can place multiple tethers, some originating 
from the south hemisphere, some from the north,  
to meet high above like guy wires on a tether, 
and hold each other in place, allowing space  
elevators to be sighted wherever we want. See 
our episode Space Elevators to learn more.
