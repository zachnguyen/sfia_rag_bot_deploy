One concern about placing large power collectors 
in space is that they might be weaponized,  
and this tends to involve worries any energy 
beam might be fired down as a laser or death  
ray. While this isn’t entirely unjustified 
as a concern, it is very difficult to make  
a laser pass through an atmosphere 
without diffusing a lot. What’s more,  
high-energy beams also seriously heat up the 
air they pass through, called thermal blooming,  
which further disrupts the beam. So Lasers in 
space can be weaponized for use against Earth  
but only by careful design, rather than hijacking 
and would not be your go-to orbital weapon. See  
our episode Orbital Bombardment for examples.
They are also very vulnerable to attack from  
a groundside laser, which can be more 
heavily powered, cheaper, and fortified,  
and lasers work just fine for space-to-space 
attack. They’re an excellent option for helping  
to clear space debris safely and could be scaled 
up to help propel spacecraft to very high speeds.
