There are a number of alternatives to a space 
elevator like the orbital ring, tethered ring,  
and Lofstrom loop that create a stable platform 
you can place either in a ring around the planet  
or a stationary runway suspended in the air 
by active support. These can be at any given  
altitude and also turned at various angles besides 
along the equator to pass over cities they might  
service, and offer a method of getting into 
space that is vastly cheaper per launch than  
rockets and requires no new materials like a 
space elevator does. They are quite expensive  
to build and maintain though, like a highway, 
so building one is something you do when you  
want hundreds of launches a day, not a year. But 
if you built several at different altitudes that  
were one above the other or crisscrossed, you 
could string a tether up that didn’t need to be  
as strong as a space elevator but could rise high 
into space,like an elevator, and potentially allow  
rapid and cheap travel from anywhere on earth 
to another point or into interplanetary space.
