Often in discussion of life extension 
technology we seek to avoid the word  
immortality because it implies an infinite 
lifespan utterly immune to entropy or injury,  
which would not seem possible under 
known science in a finite universe,  
even while lifespans of thousands, millions, 
or even trillions of years would seem viable.  
Biological Immortality is an exception to this, 
as while the term is not ideal it is already in  
use. It specifically refers to a body which does 
not meaningfully age and is highly resistant  
to injury or regenerative. This may 
occur naturally in some alien biology,  
and might be accomplished by medical nanobots 
restoring aging cells or repairing damaged DNA,  
or any number of other methods we discussed in the 
episode the Science of Aging, but is seen as an  
alternative to mind uploading, cloning, or other 
methods of hypothetical life extension. See our  
episodes the Effects of Life Extension Technology 
and the Ethics of Life extension for further  
discussion of the science, technology, benefits, 
and challenges of Radical Life Extension.
