Cosmic Strings are hypothetical objects in  
cosmology. The concept is a very thin and ultra 
dense string in space that would be topological  
defects leftover from the early universe as 
spacetime expanded. Think of a block of ice full  
of cracks, only much larger, and the cracks are 
in spacetime itself. While a cosmic string would  
be thinner than even an atomic nucleus, they still 
would pack around a billion-billion tons of mass  
in each meter or yard of length, and they could 
potentially stretch a billion light years or more.  
They should cause gravitational lensing like 
a black hole, only long and skinny rather than  
point-like. They would also vibrate, move, and 
potentially evaporate, which would leave a visible  
wake as they passed through interstellar gasses. 
As such, they should be detectable if they exist,  
and as of yet have not been found. 2-dimensional 
versions of these are called domain walls, and we  
also have monopoles as well as other predicted but 
not yet discovered topological defects in reality.
