Birch Planets
I sometimes get asked what the biggest artificial
planet or habitat you could possibly engineer
is, and an answer comes from the late great
Paul Birch, who suggested you could build
an enormous planetary shell around the supermassive
black hole at the center of our galaxy, 4
million times as massive as our own sun, or
1.4 trillion times the living area of Earth.
More living area than if every rocky planet
in this galaxy was terraformed.
And yet that is just the bottom end of the
megastructure we name in his honor, because
you could feed all your surplus matter in
a galaxy into a black hole, using that to
power your civilization, and build a structure
around it with normal Earth gravity that was
nearly a light year across, massed as much
as our entire galaxy, and had a billion-billion
times the living area of Earth and likely
more than every habitable planet in the observable
Universe combined.
See our episode Mega Earths for details on
how such titanic creations can be made under
known science.
