S020 Von Braun Space Station August 22, 2023
First designed by Wernher von Braun in 1945,  
this ring or torus shaped space station is one 
of the earliest models of space station that  
included artificial spin-gravity. The original 
design is made of 20 cylindrical segments,  
3 meters or 10 feet in diameter, and 8 meters or 
26 feet long. Each linked at the end to the next  
by an airlock door and at a slight angle to form a 
circle of 20 segments, and connected by a spoke to  
the central hub, this is also popularly known as 
a wheel design, and some inflatable versions are  
essentially identical to a large bicycle wheel. 
By having spokes or tether connected to a hub,  
it is possible to add segments as you go, 
rather than waiting for a complete circle,  
and some suggest that rocket boosters 
could be collected and repurposed to  
make such a station instead of letting them 
drop back into the atmosphere to burn up.

examples of space habitats and stations.
