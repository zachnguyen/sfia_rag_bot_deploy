The Banks Orbital is an enormous space habitat
with hundreds of times more living area than
a normal planet and gravity generated by rotating
an immense ring once every 24 hours.
First suggested in scifi writer Iain M. Banks
Novel Consider Phlebas, where it is envisioned
as an immense thin ring in space over a million
miles wide and where such structures, often
nicknamed Godâ€™s Bracelet, are commonly built
as an alternative to terraforming a planet
as they are considerably larger than a planet
but use less raw material to make.
Unlike most spin gravity environments, it
has a natural day and night with a true starry
night, and can even have regular seasons by
being tipped on its axis like Earth is.
While smaller than a Niven Ringworld, it would
seem more likely a civilization would choose
to build many Banks Orbitals instead, and
in our Ringworlds episode we discussed how
either might be constructed under known physics.
