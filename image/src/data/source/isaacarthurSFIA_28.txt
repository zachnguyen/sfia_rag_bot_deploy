Hello everyone from Science & Futurism! After 
a repeated requests over the years I’m glad to  
announce we’re finally introducing Youtube Channel 
Memberships to our ways to help support the show,  
while also gaining access to fun perks 
like specialized badges and emojis,  
priority replies to comments, 
high-resolution versions of our  
cover art, and members-only posts 
and social media access & chat.
If you’re interested in joining, 
just click the join button under  
the video and you can find out more 
about the options for memberships.
If you’d like to help support the show 
but would rather have some other option,  
you can also help out at patreon, 
subscscribestar, or options like  
paypal or even snail mail that you can find on our 
website, IsaacArthur.net. And everytime you watch,  
like, share, or comment on a video it 
helps us out with the algorithm too. 
As always, thanks for watching, 
and have a great week!
