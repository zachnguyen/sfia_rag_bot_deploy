see what's actually
good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink and a
snack
though we'll take a break about halfway
through too with all that said
welcome and let's get started
good afternoon and welcome to our
monthly live stream q a
uh we'll start taking questions in just
a moment but for those of you who are
new to this
we take questions from the audience as
we go just put them in the chat window
and as we go through those get relayed
to our moderators who are sending my
wife who will answer the questions
and she'll be asking the questions as we
go through and my wife sarah will go
ahead and get us started
i think you mean i'm going to ask you
the questions you said answer and i
think that's your job i'm going to
answer the question
it's a day off all right okay well we
are going to kick it
off here with a question from michael
thunder burke he says
is it possible that all the satellites
mr musk and others are putting into
orbit could cause the beginning of a
kessler syndrome
yes absolutely would you
care to elaborate for those of you who
don't know what kessler syndrome is
we're up in space which is mostly empty
that's why we call it space
uh things are moving around very quickly
uh so they move around a lot and they
cover a lot of distance everything's
moving a hundred times faster than your
typical bullet
when it hits something if it hits
something if a little piece of debris
hits something
it tends to kick out a piece of debris
and then several hundred more
and then several thousand more and those
little bits of debris which are also
moving fast can hit something else
and cause of kind of a chain reaction
that's been called kessler syndrome
and if you have a lot of objects up
there already worried about a lot of
navigational hazards and debris
there's always concern that what might
happen is you might get so much stuff in
orbit
that when one of these reactions
happened it shredded everything and
basically put a cloud of debris around
this the planet
in fact that was something that happened
in a game thing called rifts
where they couldn't get into space
anymore even though they had technology
for because their entire orbital area
was covered in debris
now the good news about that is we'd
have to put a lot more satellites up
there for that would really be a huge
risk
and most sites put up right now
relatively small the other good news is
that things that are in damage
usually decay even faster than normal
things in orbit and very few things stay
in lower but for more than a decade or
two without major assistance
usually a lot less than that depends on
how high open they are alternatively
medium and high orbit where things can
go out a lot longer and
in bad orbits is just so much bigger and
has so much less stuff in it too
that's less of a concern the k2 despot
says hey isaac what would the upper
limit on reversible or quantum computer
that uses quantum memory
given that quantum memory can avoid the
margulis
leviton limit or at least wikipedia has
said so
trying to give an upper limit on
something like quantum we have so little
actual data yet on how quantum computing
works from a practical standpoint is
something i'm going to have to pass on
reversible computing
we did look that in the iron stars
episode i think civilization the end of
time
iron stars and i don't know what it was
off the top of my head
but i think for that one we found you
put a pocket computer in place if you
were doing at the atomic level
that would be able to run something like
an entire universe size simulation
though don't quote me on that go see the
video folks
why that was the case tobias brown
says he has a question about o'neill
cylinders
how would you deal with something
leaving the surface of it as once you do
you are no longer affected by the
gravity
you are still affected by the gravity as
much as you will beforehand
this is a common misimpression people
get about the o'neill cylinder and i've
even seen in some books sometimes
um i think it was in a star wars book uh
fear the jedi
luke skywalker jumps up in the air on
board while he's rotating space stations
and his feet leave the ground and this
other thing goes underneath him he keeps
spinning and he doesn't
that's not how that works uh you are not
being pinned to it by gravity
you are flying forward and so is it so
if you jump up in the air
you're going to land right back where
you were again minus the slight change
for centrifugal
and coriolis forces which get on earth
too how big those are depends on how
fast it's spinning how wide it is
etcetera
but again as an example that same thing
applies when you jump up on earth
it's gravity approach down here there
it's your own inertia but if you
take the image of one and you start
speeding around what you notice is
here you are it's spinning around like
this you spin around and so you're
spinning
all that you're doing is basically doing
a little leap but you like right in the
same place
because you're the same notion of the
side that you had beforehand
very interesting so we have a question
from
uh someone i i don't know if i have the
name
here but it's kind of lengthy so i'm
going to read it in context
hey isaac i recently came across the
original papers on the transcension
hypothesis
as you may know that hypothesis is that
ever compacting technology leads to
civilizations
inhabiting black holes before they can
expand too much in space
hence no k3s are visible because they
have all disappeared into black holes
i'm aware of the shortcomings of the
theory in that it can
assumes convergence in all civilizations
but i was wondering what your thoughts
are
on the effects compacting technology
like
femo attack and black hole computers
would have on the fermi paradox
this is two different fluorine paradox
solutions they mix them all together
here
uh as in terms of convergence there are
very few cases where it's a good example
and one of those is a good example is
exactly that kind of converging
technology of miniaturization
because you would expect almost every
civilization to be focused on building
more technology
if the other source that went into space
in the first place so if they're playing
around with that kind of compactness and
miniaturization
that's a plausible way for them to
converge as civilizations and all
civilizations said that
now the miniaturization thing has
another downside uh
first with transition and the black hole
ones it's very like what we discussed in
black hole farming and in iron stars
the idea being that if you can run cold
you can run much more efficient with
your computing
so we want to be is someplace where you
are far from any heat source like the
edge of the galaxy
and the same note on that at the same
time is that it takes a time for a
switch to cool down
so if you flip it at a cold temperature
you heat it up you gotta wait for it to
cool back down again if you want that
efficiency
and uh the quarter you are the slow it
takes to cool each degree is a war
so you run very slow very efficient and
that's ideal with black holes and
something like hockey radiation
uh so the idea might be that they save
up all their fuel to burn it
later in the universe when things go
cheaper right and they get more bang for
their buck
now the miniaturization thing is another
common one with the fermi paradox the
idea being
we just keep getting more efficient with
our technology either more compact or
more miniaturized
more efficient with the computing more
efficient without power there are hard
limits on that
you know you can't build a computer
switch that's smaller than that not
without
again examples like femtotech is the
assumption using subatomic particles
well if that's the case then you can't
get smaller than whatever that subatomic
particle is going to be
there will be a hard limit and you can't
keep pushing that indefinitely
but it also assumes your growth is not
going faster and you're improving that
mentalization
so you're always going to be increasing
your size your growth as well in terms
of our population of our power and
energy
even while you're shrinking things down
once you hit that hard limit
you're going to spill back over need to
expand in real space and real mass again
and uh that is a very short timeline you
know
to the 20th power right is a million
ford 1 million 48
576 right that's how much you're going
to increase in just 20 generations
that's 40 years the universe is 14
billion years old
it's just not a time scale worthy of
note in terms of fully paradox solutions
robert says can we just check you real
quick is that told me to look at the
camera better or
scooch over oh okay
because i want to see that star wars elf
hat with the ears sticking out over your
head
i could just put it on after the point
that's good
okay now that we interrupted that we
have a question here from robert
if you're curious my wife sometimes
gives me little hand signals like speed
up slow down
uh and get on and this one was
now we can all admire those elf ears now
if you hold your head up straight there
we go
robert says can we realistically operate
telescopes on the far side of the moon
anytime
soon um i guess it depends on what you
mean by anytime soon
the one nice thing about fall side
telescopes uh on the moon
is that we could actually make them out
of a liquid metal like mercury
um there are not very many things that
actually act as a liquid in a vacuum and
you can always pressurize just a little
bit if you needed to to get get what you
need to have a liquid but
and then you could just spin around and
the way which you spin that telescope
around will control how
your mirrors convex with concave um
so those make very nice xenotype
telescopes we do a few of those
operating um
but it's also just a great place for
astronomy in general there's nothing
stopping us
right now from sending a uh a satellite
to orbit the moon to pick up the data
from one uh because it couldn't send it
directly to us through the moon
and then just dropping a big satellite
there seems to be hubble it's expensive
uh
but there's no real technical vulnerable
anymore than it was with hubble robert
had a follow-up to that as well
do you think that we should and will
replace our sibo telescope with the moon
one or build it on the surface of earth
or mars two
and thanks for everything thank you uh i
i'm sure a lot of you heard about
aerosibo um
uh finally breaking down the storm we
haven't really been using it
for a while and it's been more of a
tourist than anything else but
it just it was such that core piece of
seti the
receiver telescope in puerto rico and uh
my platoon soldier actually was down
there visiting last year and sent me
photos for that
platoon sergeant dorvin damage um and
uh it's just a sad thing to lose that
but in terms of a place it was something
on the moon
i set up which is building a new one but
uh yeah the moon would be a great place
to be building aeroseable too and i
would definitely be down for that
uh however i guess the question would be
whether or not something like elon musk
or um
or uh jeff bezos was down for that
raven 609 what are some advantages or
disadvantages to colonizing a system
where the planets are very close to one
another like trappist-1
um i mean close always relative term we
have an episode that we come out in
january that i just finished writing a
couple weeks ago
called colonizing red dwarfs and one of
the things we point out there
is that those are very tightly compact
solar systems boarding on
moon systems like jupiter has it's
almost all advantages
uh there are a few downsides because
things a lot close together
especially something like a dyson swarm
if things are a lot denser you have to
worry a little bit more about collision
scenarios there
but for the most part if your source
system is more compact it just makes
colonization easier
uh communication faster the only
downside is you're more vulnerable to
military action because you've less time
to see them coming and take action and
it
costs less to send stuff as well so i
suppose
uh if you live in a more compact system
like a moon system around a gas giant or
around a red dwarf
it helps to have uh neighbors who you
like and get along with
it's good for your neighborhood uh
relations policy
household adventure says hey isaac what
are your thoughts on civilizations that
start closer to the galactic core where
stars are more dense
the loose notion is that if there were
earlier civilizations they'd more likely
have started near the core because you
had higher levels of metalistic early on
um downside of course you have a lot
more supernovas
uh both in terms of what's composing the
things out there
uh stars not evenly distributed by a
copy of my type stellar classification
um and uh because it's just much denser
um it's a great place to colonize once
you have your radiation shooting in
place a great place to go it's not that
radioactive but
i'd be very pessimistic about anything
in the actual central bulge being a good
place to to live a classic
uh earth-like planet life on um
but uh in terms of civilization just a
little bit close to the core
yes and that's probably even
preferential as a place to start
with the obvious caveat that if uh if
one of our great filters
is things like galactic explosions at
the core or major supernova events
then obviously it would not be a good
place to start life off that
johnny wing says how will an
interplanetary civilization deal with
time
will every planet have their own year
system and what counts as a minute when
you're dealing with time dilation
i think we looked at that in a lot of
detail and i think was uh
you know cell civilizations and time
maybe back last year but
basically i think you'll end up having
almost everybody
lock their clock to us as their main one
now plants are going to use their own
schedule right and i think a lot of them
would start off by
not using time zones i think you just
have
whatever the capital of mars was aries
one that's the time and everybody else
use that as their clock
for uh you know what time of official
day it is and i think anytime you go to
a new solar system they're almost going
to have to do that because they're not
going to want to waste time converting
back and forth
but you think about the solar system
here where will most people in space
live
it open around north for centuries to
come the vast majority of people who
don't live on earth are going to live
around
earth it just is the more natural
migration place
you're not going to want to use the
local calendar um
you know of every individual planet for
solar system traffic but they probably
will
if you live on you know mars you're
going to adapt that schedule you talk
about millions of people
so you're gonna have your own local
calendar but you're probably switched
over to an all standard time as
your commerce one and you might even
switch over some like metric time you
know the uh
or with star trek starting method where
you set up here's time zero
and we just measure things in
kiloseconds and mega seconds and
uh gigaseconds and a gigasecond is about
30 years for instance so
you might do your time well based on
that you know you worry about what time
of day it is used
mark it out perpetually
dt phenom hey how do you think religion
and belief systems would evolve as
humanity ventures into the stars
would they become even more widespread
in a post-scarcity society looking for
purpose or die off
i would take as a given that you have
more of them just get more people
um you know there's any time you have a
major religious movement
you see diversification of that too uh
like past and reformation is giving
brought to
how many hundreds of churches and when
you start spreading that around
to areas that can't talk to each other
quickly they're all separated by light
years
then you have to assume there'll be a
lot of variations uh the obvious
opposite of that is if you can prove
definitively one of these systems is
definitely correct
then things would converge in that
direction everyone would think so
but by default i would tend to assume
that you would always see more
diversification
um borrowing the extreme tyranny
situation uh more diversification of
political systems economic systems
and uh religious you know ideologies
things like that
there are enough factors that could
interfere with that but that would be
the default to me
brian a bear how soon will moon crater
cities be possible
today i mean we could do them today if
we really wanted to we could do them
today
um what's got to be they always be a
reason why you have thousands of people
living there
you know it's not a city that doesn't
have in in
a certain population here in ohio we use
the definition that something is a city
that's got 5 000 people and it's
incorporated
uh if it's not incorporated in our city
and if it has less than five thousand
people it's a village
so if it's a moon crater city it's got
five thousand people in it
we would need to have a lot of people
living on the moon and actually
that's not like amount you subsidize
like mcmurdo in antarctica there's what
500 people there
um 5 000 is quite a push so and plural
cities
and that doesn't include all people
living in rural areas around it what are
they doing there
um i would tend to think about a century
or something like that because you have
to have that first economic thing that's
actually pushing it
right and again wouldn't be like a
military base that's a city that's
that's military base
you might have a city pop around it but
then that would have a certain
population
in the base for so until you have
something in space that i would say has
to be at least a
100 billion dollar euro sector of profit
fly area then i would say no
no cities up there robert miller says
hey isaac i've been wondering lately if
an
um i should have
ecumen opolis lasted long enough yes
echimonopolis
lasted long enough what would be a plan
to protect the city from continental
drift and volcanic activity
hmm i mean a real econopolis that the
real deal as we've pointed out doesn't
necessarily have to be the classic
coruscant or transfer image of a steel
and concrete
paved over everything um and did you
really only get to that level if you
and of multi levels and all that if you
had like a quadrillion people
when you're building that kind of degree
uh the way you deal with continental
drift
is to move your consonants and i think
we discussed how to do that in the
mattress cohorts episode
you can if you want to move or stop
moving continents you could cut your
plant open various ways and
you know basically replace it bit by bit
until it was a sequence of shells
um and uh was i think in 40k they have
something called a hab quake for when
they had the hives or hive quakes when
the
just these giant messy pyramid
structures have been built up to house
billions of people uh something breaks
falls or shadows and the whole thing
just jumbles like a big thing of jello
um you would have that kind of thing to
worry about a lot of those cases
and there's probably a lot more
consuming than continental drift but
you don't go building things like that
until you're real confident you can
deal with uh you know 9.0 earthquakes
casually um but then you might just be
able to place them on that tectonically
active
too okay we have a question here from
floyd
spokes too you can always just nuke
stuff to fix that kind of problem
a lot are you finished yes
thank you void astra asks do you play
elite
dangerous no no i think somebody
actually even sent me a thing to join on
steam but
i have not had as much time for games i
like i think it's a first person shooter
and the last one of those i actually
played
i don't know if was left 4 dead 2 or
mass effect 3. uh so that for those of
you who are familiar with those games
that would tell you how
out of uh date i am on those
so mo pippinger says hi isaac and sarah
it was nice of them to say hi to me too
when i talk to people about ideas like
megastructures and
sublight interstellar travel people tend
to be bewildered
how can i explain these ideas in a
concise and effective way
i was kind of joking just telling to go
watch the videos oh
that is kind of how the original video
got started the mega structural summary
video from 2014
i had some authors who i was talking to
about the general idea that they used
planets too much
in in their settings there was always
these planets and always these
basically single world plants like a
little town on them for the entire
planet
and that that probably wasn't likely to
be our future but if they want to do
that kind of setup they should just use
a make structure like
neo cylinder anyway and i got so tired
of explaining though that i just went
ahead and put together a compilation
video of all the various megastructures
and how they worked and that's how the
channel got started so
i don't know if there really is an easy
way to explain them it usually takes
about 30 minutes to feel like i've given
a basic summary
so mo you might have a new idea for a a
channel
and again we could actually use more
videos on those so by all means if
someone feels like doing some more
in-depth videos on those make them
send them out they'll you know and god
bless
vi sci-fi how would you begin
construction of orbital rings
build up and lift into orbit or ring
earth and
drop and drop
the usual thought is that it would be
easier if you could build them on the
ground and float them up but that's in
the modern context
you don't build an orbital ring unless
you have so much traffic moving back and
forth to space
that it justifies things existence
because they can get your stuff into
space for like a dollar a pound or
dollar kilo kind of cost ranges that's
amazing right
problem is that you're talking about a
multi-billion dollar infrastructure at
the minimum
you know probably more like hundreds of
billions of dollars or way more to build
one of these things and probably
billions to maintain it every year
so you only do that when you have enough
traffic to justify that
um and don't compare just launch costs
remember the cost of fuel
which is what we're looking to save
there is a tiny portion of rocket costs
only a few percent
uh so you need to have tons and tons of
cargo going up to space
every hour every minute maybe to justify
its cost
that implies you got quite the
infrastructure in space already and
probably even sourcing that from the
moon
in which case build the thing up in
space and put it there
zim wants to know if you prefer benjamin
cisco or
jean-luc picard jean-luc pagoda oh my we
gotta get you up to the next generation
stuff we've been watching
to west together like john lipper god
everyone's favorite frenchman from
england
um ben cisco uh it's it's it's a it's
close
but uh i guess it depends on on whether
you which one would i rather be working
for and
actually i'd rather work for jane where
uh it seems like she's more of my kind
of captain as a day-to-day walking
person but
i just like ben cisco he's awesome
um obviously everybody loves jean-luc
but yeah francisco
de wall has a super chat thank you for
your contribution
and asks wouldn't the orbital debris
eventually either fall into the
atmosphere
or coalesce into rings i think after a
kessler syndrome eons later the rings
would be very pretty
let's look on the bright side
that's true there you're gonna have to
ask that king's a little bit distracted
trying to remember where we were in star
trek um
so we are about to finish season two
don't go to season three and then we
have to survive season one of tng which
is not their best season
what's the question again i think the
question was on orbital debris
falling into the atmosphere or
coalescing into rings whether that would
be pretty
um after a kessler syndrome be
absolutely gorgeous
how long would we have to wait to see
that
uh well probably within minutes of the
castle event uh actually coin
um it would start to fall down it would
be its most intense
in the in those first few weeks uh
potentially for years though
um you know earth has probably had rings
in the past uh
jupiter has ring all the gas giants have
rings um saturn probably not have such a
glorious ring at some point in the past
and will in the future
uh you get big impacts you have things
like that floating around they'll come
down
um and the good news is of course you
really well it looks very pretty until
it lands on you but i would imagine most
kessler syndrome events would
based on our orbital infrastructure
would not be the sort of thing that
caused you to have
you know mega ton objects falling out of
the sky and landing on the ground
and even just kilo tons of object
hitting the ground we're probably not
going to
have anything really bad happen to
anyone not directly underneath it but
you'll be gorgeous to watch to be sure
hopefully you have to have time to like
record and report it too
merv johnson thank you for your donation
and
merv wants to know if you could have a
han solo like private ship owner in the
context
or a dyson swarm or migrant fleet
darting between
habs and motherships what would that be
like in ship
and lifestyle in both cases absolutely
yes uh when you're inside of a dyson
swarm
uh at least we'll talk about one where
it's mostly built of things aren't
scaled or neo cylinders smaller or
bigger you know
but not all of them plant size things of
course then
your ability to drive between plant you
know between habitats is
easier uh than building a car it is
easier and cheaper to fly a thousand
kilometers to empty space to an object
that is
more or less the same relative velocity
as than it is to drive to the neighbors
nearing town here on the ground
use less fuel a biggest trick there of
course is making something that's
reasonably airtight
and even that only has to be reasonably
airtight because you'll only be in
flight for maybe
20 30 minutes an hour or something like
that um inside a migrant fleet
just as easy if not easier with dyson
storms we assume they tend to be a
little bit scattered out
although they might tend to conglomerate
together in small packs
just because they're trying to take up
that space and absorb all that sunlight
uh with a migrant fleet they just won't
be far enough apart from each other that
if one
gets hit it doesn't kill anybody else
and you know we can hit it and your
light speed
that's quite a collision so but even
then uh
something like a a border the size of a
fist team or those ships might give off
an explosion bigger than the uh
i can't believe that giant bomb they set
off in in the soviet union but the
castle bravo being the american version
would be worse than that but a few
hundred kilometers away that's not gonna
hold you much in space
uh so nigerian fleets won't be too close
to each other but they'd be close enough
that little ships like that could run
back and forth and run back and forth
for virtually no fuel
and you have to really worry about the
same level engineering because they're
only moving
maybe a few hundred meters an hour sorry
a few hundred miles an hour meters per
second
and they don't really need to have
really good quality control on anything
else other than radiation shielding
so yes you could have definitely inside
a migrant fleet
like the quorums had in mass effect or
battlestar galactica and yes in a
dyson's one we have your han solo ships
will hapricorn do you think a europa
lander mission would be feasible in the
near future
given the possible continents on the
surface
if so how um
the problem with going to europa is that
it's not really the surface that
interests us i mean there's science be
done there to be sure we could learn an
awful lot studying some ice creams there
and
seeing what the composition was for me
to cry or volcanoes that might have
erupted but we want to go blow
we want to melt through a 10 kilometer
sheet of ice probably to get to the
water below
and uh right now that would probably
your best way to do that would be to
send a
really big satellite compared to what we
normally send now that had a uh
a a fairly large video well basically an
isotope on the end of it that was going
to melt
that ice that had a long fiber optic
cable and slashed tokyo working lower
10 kilometers down through it which had
to be pretty sturdy even if the gravity
is a lot weaker there
so basically mulch your way through and
look at the ocean below uh something
like that would be pretty big
so yeah i think we could probably design
something like that easy enough nowadays
but
it'll be expensive to send uh you'd
probably be looking at
you know tens of billions to send
something right now that's a
ballpark figure but it's definitely
inside the ability of us to do if we
really wanted to like we got some
indication it was live there
isaac berdot says hi isaac what is the
least likely
and far out there solution to the fermi
paradox um
i mean that needs qualification that's
reasonably sane
or i guess with the far out there would
probably not be it um
i'd say that far out there means
reasonably unseen
the strangest ones i've ever heard um
that's a reality tv show i think that's
probably the big one that's a very
popular one that uh
not just this is a simulation or not
just that we're being kept in the zoo
but the primary purpose of that is for
other aliens to watch us
and the reason for that is well that
sounds like one of the better solutions
for those who are used to it um
it's also one of the worst solutions it
sounds crazy that you would have an
entire planet
set up for that purpose even crazier
than having the entire planet as in

set up to figure out the answer like the
universe and everything having one that
was just for reality tv show
the problem is there's so much easier to
simulate all that stuff
without using fully intelligent
organisms the whole time
and i don't really think we're all that
interesting that that if you got all
that simulation power
you find all planet that exciting so
that would be the one that was simulated
for the purpose of entertainment of
outsiders
bob joe says hello isaac arthur i would
like to know what you think about the
orion's arm universe project
i love ryan's arm it's been a while
since i've actually contributed anything
over there um
if you go looking through you'll
probably find some links that go to the
videos here
uh and if you look at the original
episode the cover it's actually from one
of
one of the pages there it was done by
steve baugh was another one
big contributors over there um before
the show started i tend to be more
active with the ryan zone
and uh unfortunately the show's kind of
taking up that part of my brain so i
focus mostly on it but i love ryan's arm
some of the fiction is hit and miss
because there's kind of a shared writing
project for those of you that know
of ion's arm is meant to be a hard
sci-fi setting with ultra realism
that people can write short stories
inside using the shared technology and
setting
and it's great for that and the
encyclopedia galactica they have there
is a great source for all sorts of
high-tech concepts like the ones we
talked about on the show
but obviously some of the individual
stories can range from very good to fan
fiction so
a question from trevor nielsen and thank
you trevor for your donation
as technology has progressed mysticism
has adopted with it
could there be come a techno priest
class an evolution of religion based on
technology
you could argue we have one like that
right now i mean usually what people
mean when they say that is they're
either talking about the the
techno mages from babylon 5 who have
turned into another magical system
or the tech priests of malice from
warhammer 40k who have turned it into an
atrocity um
i love that setting though uh it's easy
enough to imagine
that the folks who control the the bits
of knowledge would
also be very critically tied into
whatever the religion of the system was
uh that's what it was for us until
several years ago uh overall scientists
were basically in seminary schools and
they either went on to become clergy or
it wasn't so much for them and they
focused more on natural philosophy
later on but settled out so there was
one historical example there are plenty
of those
um i'd say throughout history probably
around half the time though an
anthropologist might disagree or know
better
would say about half the time whoever
was the main educated scholar class was
also the clergy class
so it's very plausible and one could
even make the argument that in some ways
modern technology has always become a
bit of a similar to
you know magical village in the past and
thus before that little right now more
technologists
um but uh so it's it's quite likely
but i don't know that necessarily it
follows the same kind of construct
um there's a quote about that from isaac
asimov's foundation
series the very first short story the
cool thing about the
religion of science was that miracles
actually walked
which is uh a point that may or may not
factor into how well it actually does
as a potential religion if people were
doing that or not so
okay i want to fit in just a couple more
questions here before the break
mark zimmerman says what do you think
the future of a large-scale
national democracy based on earth would
be as it moves
settlements further and further out into
the solar system would they be reliant
on early voting
um now for those of you didn't know my
my other
high up my day job as a war is is
running elections which was
quite a lot of fun this year um and
presidential election years are never
fun um
one of the reasons why the united states
used a system where every state runs its
own election system
is because that system was invented
before we had
um telephones and uh overnight you know
delivery of things we had to run
everything by post
so basically every state did its own
thing conducted something and usually
every county or local area conducted
their own thing
reported up and they sent their
delegation to go vote on thing later on
you kind of have to go back to a system
like that not to say that system though
when you start doing with anything
beyond the interplanetary scale now
at the end you know planetary scale you
can still do everybody votes at the same
time will have a given day for it
the time lag is not that bad in this
solar system
even pluto is a day back and forth
right you get out to the kuiper belt to
beyonce beyond the kuiper belt into what
we think of as you know
cloud you start looking at days then
weeks and even months
you to the interstellar scale you are
talking decades you know so
obviously there's some challenges there
if you try to everybody vote the same
time and the question of
what time they should be voting at um
you know should they all be let's say
that you had a rule that said we had to
vote after the last debate they had
between the two candidates
and no one's about to vote till then so
you're out on pluto your pools don't
open for 12 hours after they opened on
earth and then they run for every time
they're going to be open to you send the
results back 12 hours later and
everyone's sitting at home going
what's wrong with pluto it's been like
two days so you know
um but i think that that that kind of
depends on whether you have a
centralized panel of federated power
more confederate setup that's gonna be a
much more you know
your mileage may vary but inside one
solar system you should be able to use
all the major systems
that we see in play on earth um and
again most of those systems
predate telephones so you know even
anything like a fast postal service
so the last question i'm going to ask
for a pre-break
is from wpr and he wants to know when
humanity is living away from the earth
how will santa deliver the gifts
wormholes see what he does now wait will
the reindeer be able to do that too
yes there was a a rather famous old
essay that was flowing on the internet
for a long time that calculated how fast
santa would have to move in order to
actually get to everybody's house in one
night
and found that he would explode a lot of
the rain down um
speedy was moving out too fast right uh
as a result of this
um and you know he has basically moving
at relativistic speeds
it stands the reason the only way he
could possibly have done doing that is
through more holes in time manipulation
in the first place
since that was out of play that means he
would not have any problems whatsoever
delivering plants
it gives to other plants therefore
children on pluto will get their gifts
on christmas same as everybody else
well that's good news and at that no we
should probably take a quick break
we'll be taking a break for a couple of
minutes so it's a great time to grab a
drink and a snack
as well as get more questions into our
moderators in the chat for sarah to
reach me in the second half of our show
there will probably be a shorter break
than usual since our mid livestream
breaks were traditionally intended to
let me grab a cigarette
and i quit a couple months back i've
been holding off on mentioning that to
make sure i actually successfully did
quit and stayed quit
and a lot of the aliens has been
encouraging me to quit for some time and
since i finally did i want to thank all
of you who had suggested that and let
you know that i had done so
and for anyone who's on the fence about
trying to quit i can only speak from my
own experience
but going core turkey is not a lot of
fun but it can be
done and sooner is always better than
later
speaking of turkey since we're in
thanksgiving weekend i hope everyone had
a good thanksgiving
complete with stuffing your stomach to
capacity and took some time to think on
what they are thankful for
we spend a lot of time looking at the
future and hopefully how awesome it will
be
and it's often easy to forget especially
this year how much we have to be
thankful for as a civilization
and i hope you have plenty to be
thankful for individually
i know i do the show has continued to
grow in 2020 and guitierrez let me do
something i truly love
which is always a wonderful quality to
have in your job
speaking of jobs and being thankful my
wife sarah fowler arthur
the young lady reading the questions off
during our live streams
was just elected this november to
represent our district of ohio in the
house of representatives
and we'll be leaving her post on the
ohio board of education as a result
where she sold for the last eight years
since the first election in 2012
we also just celebrated our six month
wedding anniversary and one year
anniversary of when i asked her to marry
me
so those are two other things i'm
thankful for this jigor
i think most of us will be glad to see
the backside of this year
2020 has been a rough one and i won't
miss it either but it's also been a very
good year
and an awful lot of this has been from
the show and i want to thank all of you
for tuning in every week
i hope 2020 has given you some things to
be thankful for too
it was just being thankful the year is
almost over and we can head into a
brighter future
and now back to the show and discussing
that brighter future
okay i think that was the end of that
one so i'm only wearing this for a
couple of questions that's that and then
that
goes off all right let's go ahead and
get back to it
oh my well it fits your head better
there than it did
hanging up as well
[Applause]
okay the first question is from me are
you planning on helping santa explore
those wormholes and deliver gifts to
pluto this
no i don't believe it fictional not like
santa
okay joel cruzma says i have a question
which
which probability would you put on a
runaway greenhouse making
the earth practically uninhabitable
during this or the next century
not high um the the thing about a runway
greenhouse effect is that that notion
mostly comes from early studying of
venus
um and uh you could definitely wreck a
planet by putting too much carbon
dioxide on it
uh and we don't really know what the
runaway point on that would be but
i don't think we actually get the plant
hot enough through carbon dioxide to
actually
uh to take it up to what we call it to
like anything approaching the venusian
temperatures
um and uh well before you got that point
in terms of of
concentration uh you know carbon dioxide
has many qualities to it uh when you're
breathing it one of the lesser known
ones it makes you stupid
so um this actually comes up in
classrooms not well ventilated these
students will start to get dumber after
a while because
you get lethargic breathing the stuff in
uh and so ventilation very important by
the way
and of course billions always have a
little bit higher concentration but if
your actual atmosphere gets that
concentrated with it uh well you won't
have anyone who was able to think about
how to solve the problem anymore
um if two nearby planets develop
intelligent life
how would their ability to communicate
through telescopes and other means to
affect their development what was the
first piece again
if two nearby planets develop
intelligent life
how would their ability to communicate
through telescopes and other means
affect their development
i mean unless it was a double planet
like where basically the moon was a
planet too
they'd still be far enough away that
they could only even know that the other
planet would held any kind of life or
had the potential for it when they got
to
maybe like the 19th century about when
we started looking at mars enough detail
to think that we were seeing canals
you know and things like that at that
point in time
um i may be really freakishly unlikely
they both happen to be at the same level
of development
but if they were i would assume that
they would
huh i don't know
i don't know how you go about
communicating case like that i feel like
i'd like to explore that more
might make a very good story but uh
ah because the only thing you'd be able
to actually set out that would be bright
enough if we talked about visually would
be something like a nuke
um and i've ever thought that was a good
way to open up conversations
um i mean radio would be the obvious one
you typically you basically if you're
running on the same payload time onto us
they'd be getting radio about the same
time they'd be able to look at those
plans enough detail to even believe they
have life on them
you know they recycling the most
anything other than an actual orbital
satellite around it with enough detail
to
pick out something like a forest even so
probably video i think that might flow
into this question from cosmo explorer
101
if humanity becomes interstellar could
the languages of other star systems
become
so different that communication becomes
nearly impossible
yes and no it could easily do that but
the thing is
while you're separating space and time
and off a lot
um i mean if your neighbors are 10 light
years away from you and you're sending
signals back and forth that means you're
getting their signals 10 years old
a language has a shift very quickly for
that to be the case
and you know somebody who's 10 000 light
years away from you yes they're going to
have
such a language shift that if you were
not talking them at all in the meantime
but um you still have all those plants
in between who presumably had
better tracks of what was out there
their lighting in the meantime it could
translate for you
so you might send messages back and
forth down the chain but more
importantly
if you're doing interstellar
communication you presumably have
computers records and archives and you
can
be checking what everybody's language
from ten thousand years ago was since
you had it you have those recordings
still
just to demonstrate that i've been
paying attention while we were watching
star trek you would have an interstellar
decoding device of course oh yeah like
the universal translator yeah
i always like the babel fish from
douglas m better though so
stick a little fish in your ear
anyone who has not watched star trek
over at hitchhiker's guide the galaxy
you should
when you when this s over you should go
and do that not immediately
that means that means you have another
20 minutes before you're allowed to go
do that
alexander seaman says how long do you
think it will take for space colonies to
develop their own cultures and
identities
it's gonna horrify people by the way but
i still not seen the mandalorian star
wars thing yet
um speaking of yoda um
how long would they develop their own
distinct cultures
unless they're a sleeper ship like if
they're freezing themselves for the
journey they should start developing the
culture the moment they leave
and i don't even mean the sense of like
oh they're being divorced the moment
they're gone
um there's such a cultural shift just to
adapting to living on board a spaceship
like that as you get further and further
away from your own civilization
uh and all that like that by the time
they get that new solar system they
already have developed a new
civilization it's not gonna be like well
we've come here to change our ways in
the earth life they'll be like well we
come here to
change our ways from the spaceship we
came on and that that you know horrible
autocracy of the captain and then and
then all of his crew pushing us around
now we are in separate independent area
just like they had an oauth you know so
um
so i mean almost right away kobe asks
what are our chances of reaching a
cyberpunk style
transhumanist future and how far away
are we
um i mean we were talking like a
shadowrun style one where there are
like demons that pop out of things uh
hopefully not and save for a riffstar
one
uh i don't really think that i mean
i my favorite movie to this day is still
blade runner that's like the original
cyberpunk
film and then you've got uh gibson's
norman so book series and like uh snow
crash by neil stephenson
um those painted image of a future
that has been very popular for a long
time now in the cyberpunk genre
that is still based off of like the
1980s max headroom
early vr notion of how the future will
be
i don't think that specifically is
likely to ever happen as a result
as to a lot of the technologies in place
like being able to live in a virtual
reality
or be able to live in augmented reality
very soon
you know we're already kind of there in
some ways um
we're seeing more of our changes it's
not just like we'd expect to be but like
the smartphone for instance is already a
very cyber funky thing that we don't
think about that way
um small glasses for those who have them
you know google glasses
uh many other things like augmentation
wait and see yeah we already have
cybernetic augmentation we got those
cochlear devices we got
you know pacemakers and other things
more will come
and in our lifetimes plastic pinocchio
thank you for your donation
and his question is life on venus are we
ready to pound the gavel or not i just
can't get
how all that phosphine could be there
great stream as always
i am agnostic on the actual phosphorus
content of
venus for now one of the jokes we had on
there is most people
who were paying attention to the
astronomy event in uh were
overjoyed or you know angry about the
discovery of phosphorus or the reported
discovery on phosphorus
i think i was the only person who was
irritated by it because being an episode
discussing phosphorus coming out right
then that was getting ready to air
when that news broke and i had to go
back and change it to the last minute
uh and thank you to one of my knowledge
cherry corn for helping me do that and
mark
wahlbourne too one of the other editors
uh for hoping with uh some of the
chemistry on that
um because we do a last minute change
and report on that
um i don't know how much phosphorus
we're gonna find out actually exists in
the form of phosphine on venus
when we actually are able to do real
hard looks at it as opposed to these
initial evidences
but it's not gonna be a lot as to life
itself there i just don't see it
maybe microbes in the upper atmosphere
but i suspect we got there we find out
they are actually from some meteorite on
all
that burned up while i was landing there
the real goliath asks what are the
downsides of life in a space habitat
compared to life on a planet's surface
um when you look up at the beautiful
night sky you see your neighbor's
backyard
that's that's the biggest one
so i guess it depends on whether you're
a city mouse or a country mouse to start
with
i mean there are ways you can fake a sky
in one of those but basically you look
up you're seeing somebody else is down
you know um
other than that you know there are
obviously advantages living on the
planet uh certain military advantages
you can dig down deep in the ground to
protect yourself from bombardment
uh whereas when you're living inside one
of those on your hands you're a bit
safer from minor stuff because all that
protective ground
is over you from an outsider perspective
not under you with just some thin air
above you
um you can set the temperature whatever
you want to be you can set the air
pressure whatever you want to be you can
set the gravity whatever you want to be
you can set all of them individually
whatever you want to be and you can
change them
um you can change the day length you can
change the year length
you can mess around with them a lot more
it to me it's always been the kind of
question of what's the advantage of you
know planet versus
only your son or habitat um cave versus
hut
you know or k versus skyscraper you know
uh i'll go with with the buildings we
made as opposed to the ones we found
uh and maybe tweet a little bit just as
long as you're not delaying christmas
no we're not delaying christmas that
we'll always go out on time
costas asks how connected is warhammer
40k with reality
i hope not at all
you know anyone who's familiar with that
setting uh if you ever find yourself
thinking i wish i lived in 40k
you need to to reread that setting some
war or
report to an asylum uh which to be fair
is
is usually how you get promoted in 40k
is to a fortune asylum
do so um the 40k
has certain realistic aspects though in
terms of a setting it's
there is no setting that has ever done
the idea of a galaxy swelling empire
in in terms of the sheer scale of
population and size and
administrative you know inertia and just
the idea that messages could get lost
for decades and whole worlds might get
forgotten about um
no one has done that setting that better
than 40k setting known as come with
their shield
scale of civilizations better than them
in almost every other respect it's so
unrealistic
it it's it's 10 times worse than star
wars
chasm shack hi guys wondering how long
you think
before we start creating a dyson swarm
and harvesting the power of the sun
we have an episode coming on that um i
can't remember if it's this
upcoming month of december or i think it
is december like the end of december
we'll be looking at how you could do a
low-tech culture to civilization
and i think we'll start making the
initial movements towards that in this
century even but
i think the 22nd century will be an
awful lot about beginning building
towards that
we won't need one that actually has all
the population aspects of a dyson swarm
uh in the sense of you know trillions or
near cylinders for
centuries to come but that power
collection we'll build it as fast as we
have reason to make use of the power
cheaper than it costs to build the next
elements to it or maintain them
the game crasher the master gamer thank
you for your donation
how close can a star be to another star
before a civilization needs to worry
about radiation problems
um really close uh the biggest radiation
problem you'd have to be worrying about
is them overheating your plant by the
natural light there
um like i think we covered this in the
episode uh somewhere in jupiter
if jupiter turned into a vengeful for
the smaller size uh it would have no
heating effect on earth of any practical
level
um because it the amount of radiation
when those gives off it's like a ten
thousands what the sun does
and it's five times further away so
you're dealing with something that's a
little bit brighter than the moon
um things like proxima centauri that are
a quarter of a light year away from
alpha centauri
they're the brightest star bailey but
even then i don't think proxima centauri
is the brightest star from the alpha
centauri system
uh thinking about it a star as well as
ours should be brighter than
uh proxima centauri you know it's just
also and it's just that much brighter
that it being 16 times further away
overrides that
um normally would like something like
all sun
if our sun was to magically appear where
jupiter was
then we'd have another star sky that was
a 25th as bright as our sun was
and that could happen enough to actually
tip us over into like a greenhouse
oval heats but otherwise not available
so on
thank you merv johnson for your second
donation and for just
saying hi to sarah
she is much more likable than i am i
didn't say that
i just said that it was nice of them to
say hi to me
we've had several people asking how
likely life extension is going to happen
in the next couple of decades and
whether or not it will be
extended enough for immortality
you know everybody always asks me uh
what technology i'm really hoping to
live to see
and i always tell them life extension
technology
i think that uh i mean to take a book to
payor phase i'll be degree on the topic
uh all all medicine is life extension
technology
uh and i might even take a little bit
before i say all science is live
extension technology
we already are engaging in life
extension technology and not a small way
i think we've had a little bit of a
hiccup in it in the last period where
the life expense
uh life expectancy of humanity's
actually dropped by a couple months in
last few years but
proud of that have been steady going up
by about one year for every five or six
of the past
and it shows all science continuing back
on that track um
and uh we're just gonna keep getting
living longer there's nothing really
magical about aging since a number of
factors involved and we'll get better at
fixing them constantly
so we will live to see life extension
radical life extension technology
we'll see i i tend to be of the opinion
that unless we luck out and there's
something like mitochondria
on oxidation issues that might be
fixable that we probably have to do it
by any kind of really big extension of
our centuries
probably have to do that with
nanotechnology but i hope i'm wrong
hello from ireland isaac are you
familiar with lex friedman
would you go on his podcast if he
invited you on db
um the name sounds familiar but it's
these days every name sounds similar to
me um uh
usually i go on ebay's podcast if i if
they ask
and they seem like they are polite to
their guests and they have an audience
that isn't
uh you know them and their two best
friends you know um
it it depends on time and occasion
circumstance but uh for the most part
if somebody wants me on it sounds good
conversation i'm usually glad to have it
dr bird flu thank you for your
contribution he says
hi isaac you sometimes mention faster
than light communication
separate from faster than light travel
and for me this separation implies that
faster than light communication is
somehow more probable than faster than
light travel
isn't it in the end all the same could
you elaborate on the difference
between that um you know when you when
you're stretching
special relativity or general relativity
to see if you can squeeze ftl in there
somehow
there are a couple circumstances where
fashion light communication is permitted
that travel would not be
in terms of being able to send
information i don't happen to agree with
those but usually one of the examples
there is that if you had two
objects that were completely stationary
like a wormhole completely stationary
relative to each other
you'd be able to send a signal through
those two objects but if they weren't
then you would have that time travel
paradox pop out and i'm afraid there's
not time not to go to that right now but
that's one of those additional little
wiggle room things and i'd like to
remind people with um
with almost everything involving fashion
light travel or time travel it's
when we say it's possible what we're
really saying is we can't
completely rule it out for sorting just
yet
so it's kind of like actually if it's
possible that the moon is made out of
green cheese
uh we don't know for sure there might
just be a thin layer of dust there will
be ball green sheets on the moon
as to why communication is easier than
travel i think the notion is if you can
do any of these things the smallest of
scale
um you know like something like quantum
teleportation you could teleport an atom
with a piece of information on it
much more easily you could you know
teleport as a whole human right
for examples like quantum entanglement
ftl which is not really viable either
but uh that's basically a notion why
communication would be more
available than travel but again there's
always the idea if you send information
that you send a person to tactical gamer
when do you think the technological
singularity will happen
i mean this does really depend a lot on
what you're defining at technological
singularity as i think someone said the
comments after
last live stream that i i'd uh slightly
unfairly uh
defined it uh from what courseward said
um
and of course it does vary a little bit
in definition usually
the idea behind technological
singularity that people are using
popularly
is the notion that technology is going
to keep improving so fast and they
usually mean computer technology
that there's going to be a point where
you basically spit out a a computer
guard
um and that would happen at some point
that would happen practically overnight
that is not the only definition of the
term and it does get used a lot of
different ways
another idea is the hell of a more do a
singularity and event horizon was the
idea that
technology might progress so fast that
you couldn't see what was over the
horizon
uh you couldn't make any useful
predictions about the future at that
point
and that's the definition i've always
liked a little bit more in which case i
tend to say where technological
singularity happens it depends on what
you're looking to see
and how how closely you need to look at
it um but i really don't like
technological singularities they've
always struck me as way too much due sex
machina
and way too much of assumption that
something magic is gonna happen
with these things usually we start
looking at them in more detail more
comprehensively we see that there's
certain logic and some
normality to it all and so i don't think
that i'd ever expected technological
singularity to happen even though almost
everything predicted by various
technological singularities is something
i tend to expect in our timeline at some
point
we have a question from master
incredible how would civilizations on
different
time dilated planets such as around a
black hole
adapt to the time differential between
planets i mean it'd be pretty minimal
um you would have to have something that
was of the galactic core
kind of mass and maybe even full-blown
galaxy mass black holes to have plants
opening around them at time dilations
that won't be ripped apart by that orbit
um and we say galactic core mass the
the black hole in snowball galaxy weighs
about four million uh solar masses
uh also main one uh the galaxy itself
weight is more like a trillion
uh so there is a big big mass difference
between those
um somewhere between those two levels of
mass
uh you because the black holes have a
radius equal to
lydial to their mass so you double its
mass you double the radius
somewhere in that range between a
galactic core mass and a full galactic
mass black hole
you should have a stable orbit where
planet could exist and still be under
time violation
right of significant time violation
possibly more than one and you'd have to
be on the bigger side to allow more than
one
they'd all be dead though from living
there unless you very carefully engineer
that that's not a place where you're
going to have natural orbits
under time dilation now a natural black
hole can have plants around it there is
no reason whatsoever why a black hole
cannot have plants over the end
it's a big misnomer about supernova that
they blow up with such force they
destroy every plant their solar system
they do not
right they can they probably melt the
ones like mercury and venus but these
are very big stars and their planets are
quite far away something like jupiter
would survive that they'd have it
so far scorched off but it would turn
back into a planet again after a while
it's just a little bit less mass and so
if a supernova goes off and makes a
black hole there's gonna be plants
already around it
maybe not real close but there won't be
any place where people could live
because there's no light
and they have to be a lot closer than
that for the navy kind of time dilation
like that
for those of you curious loosely
speaking you can
calculate the time dilation from general
relativity or from gravity
by figuring out what the escape velocity
is from that object
at whatever distance you're at and that
escape velocity
take that into your normal domensian
equation and figure out what your gamma
is your events factor
for your time dilation so case
alchemists
10 says how would a k-3 civilization
create a sun moon for terraforming a
rogue planet
you only briefly touched on them in the
making sun's episode
i want to see a real geocentric system
oh my um
the for those of you who are wondering
and of course you go see the episode
making suns for details
sun moons uh was one of our example
where you take a very big planet and
make an artificial moon or a
moon around it that was an artificial
lighting thing so you had a geocentric
system
um that could be done relatively low
tech you could do that on
a tightly locked planet in the middle of
the void like a rogue planet
by just making a very powerful reactor
that was powering a light bulb
uh that was orbiting like a moon wood at
when you're being geocentric orbit or
not geocentric but 24-hour orbit around
the thing
which could not be geocentric in that
particular context um
you could do that with a black hole
pretty easily um
if you could make an artificial black
hole that had that level of hocking
radiation
and put something around it so that was
changing the gamma and x-rays that came
out of it and something more life
friendly like
sunlight um that that's probably the way
you do that most easily is either by a
really big fusion reactor
a really big mirror and laser system
pushing light from somewhere else
like your plants way out there and it
gets sent light from the sun that's
going through a laser or a big lens to
get to a mirror that orbits the planet
uh or buy something like a black or some
other power generation system
at that point i'm just creating a lot of
light and doing on something that is
uh opening a 24-hour period i think we
have time for
one more question about two more
questions yeah i was going to try to fit
in just a couple more here
um thank you joseph viscaletti for your
donation and he would like to know
if you think we will reach a state by
the end of this century where we
eliminate aging and disease
probably not eliminate but i think by
the end of the century
that people start being very serious but
i think you have the idea that
you're not gonna die of old age or
disease yeah okay we have another
contribution here from tom michael
good day to you both thank you
considering all that is going on today
do you think you might consider doing an
episode on
education for the children of the future
and how the techniques of teaching
learning and studying may change
i know you've touched on that in a few
of the past live streams in a little bit
here on there yeah a future of education
video
um well uh my wife's been on the state
board of education for ohio for the last
eight years so it's one of those things
where when you're living with the export
you're sometimes a little bit more
nervous about making mistakes
uh truth be told i'm a little hesitant
through a future on education episode
just because it'll be a question whether
it'd be a really close look over the
fallout one but it's one of those
episodes it's been on the back plate
boiled off for a long time
see if we got a couple more questions
yeah i just i had two more
um eric johansson also uh thank you for
your generous donation
and he would like to know if you
personally believe that powerful
relativistic projectiles could be
effectively and reliably countered
yes you'd have a general idea where
they're coming from we're talking about
things like rkms
somebody's shooting those out at you
from another solar system you get your
radar out there a long ways ahead
and you have something ready to shoot
something in the right direction of them
it doesn't take much a little pebble and
the right spot's going to do it
they're actually relatively easily
detected and countered if you're set up
for it but they still are
like anything else that's a weapon very
powerful so
not magic okay and thank you also mike
for your contribution
and he said how do you think governments
will evolve if we intend to become
sustainable
will that be at the national level or
the international level
um it's if it is it's going to have to
be at the national level
i've never counted on anything at the
international level being a situation
where you could really expect it to
work out well you know the smaller the
solution is the easier it is to actually
get people to implement it
uh local sustainability is always thing
to focus on first
if you can get that working then then
you can do that locally and other people
can start doing it too
and i think i'm going to squeak in one
more from jay baptiste
do you think a planet in which seasons
are all messed up and irregular is
possible
like in the game of thrones i mean we
touched on that before
the irregular time frame in the red
dwarfs episode in january too we look at
some interesting ones there
and i remember checking this and see if
winds of winter was actually making any
progress and apparently you'll be out
next year
and we're hearing that a couple years
ago um we don't really know what happens
with the weather there any kind of
detailed set up to be able to look at it
i think
george ramon has said that it's a magic
based effect as opposed to sort of weird
planetary setup but
you could absolutely have long winters
and short windows where it was
very cold every decade and uh a little
record every winter which is what they
have there kind of
but having a regular cycle that'd be
hard to pull off i could put together a
system
that could do that for most setups
though but yes and no
so all right we'll go ahead and sign off
therefore for today um we have another
episode coming out on thursday and we
hope to see you there thank you very
much
and have a great week
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook
reddit discord or our website
isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
thursday
