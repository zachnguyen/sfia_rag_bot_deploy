benjamin franklin once wrote in this
world nothing can be said to be certain
except death and taxes and maybe he was
wrong about that
so today we'll be looking at
resurrection restoration revivification
and various philosophical and
technological approaches to these
including some concepts like quantum
reincarnation
and some thought experiments like roko's
basilisk a type of a causal event that
mimics time travel
by threatening to resurrect people to
torture them
resurrection is the restoration of life
to those who have perished
and it is one half of the solution to
the immortality or radical life
extension
problem for any machine or system part
of keeping a body or machine alive is
keeping it in good maintenance reversing
or hardening it against decay
and the other part is fixing it when it
undergoes catastrophic breakdown or in
this case
when someone dies after all life
extension doesn't protect you from
somehow getting your darwin award
the first thing we have to do in order
to discuss resurrection is to define
when someone is dead
that's no easy task and it's in large
part because we often move the goal
post death is a bit of a gray area but
since life after death and resurrection
are traditionally the sole domain of the
divine not doctors and scientists
part of our problem is that talking
about resurrecting folks through
technology can be offensive
so when someone is dead and we bring
them back we tend to use terms like
revive or resuscitate and essentially
claim they were not dead at all
one can make that argument of course but
it is likely to be a definition doctors
are going to need to increasingly
stretch
in decades to come as we get better at
medicine we cannot use any definition
that revolves around human intervention
as in to say someone will be dead if we
did not give them cpr
as that works no better than if we said
someone who was bleeding to death was
already dead unless we applied a
tourniquet
we know someone is clearly not dead if
their heart stops because not only can
we often restart them
we can outright repair or replace it
either by transplant or some machine
that does the job
a man with a cybernetic heart is no more
dead than a man with a pacemaker or
transplant heart even if that hurt
does not actually beat so we have gotten
away from pulse or breath as measures of
vitality
and some folks suggest brain death but
this seems destined to be an equally
movable goal post
indeed prior to modern science sleep was
often regarded as a daily form of
quasi-death
i don't think you could say that death
was a state at which a person cannot be
revived by any known means
as that's not a strong foundation for
definition but to be honest this is
pretty much how we define it currently
and thus if resurrection is specifically
the reversal of death it would be a
fairly useless term
of course death might be rather hard to
define since we have to do it in terms
of life and we still do not have a very
clear definition of what life is either
so for today we will be looking at ways
in which we can bring folks back from
what we would currently tend to consider
irrevocably dead and let philosophers
and theologians worry about the specific
definition
not that we can entirely escape the
issue today either as an example if i
resurrect someone by taking a recording
of their brain states and running them
on a computer
i could say i resurrected them and some
of the more found a way to repair their
body afterward and got them breathing
again
possibly without brain damage or being
able to repair it from the same
recording
then we have apparently resurrected
someone twice now and they could either
both or neither be the original person
or two separate people
and that's a lot more confusing and hard
to find when you have two of them
sitting there
in a classic resurrection case like
lazarus this is done by divine
intervention
so you presumably have an expert
authority to turn to and ask if you're
in doubt if this is the original person
someone new or some demon or swordless
abomination
when we do it through technology it's a
little hard to speak with philosophic
certainty on the matter
our real focus today is discuss how to
bring people back from the dead
indefinitely
and from nearly anything and that is
going to require a lot of contemplation
of what we even mean by being alive
or surviving indeed we have to
contemplate survival in the context of
preservation of identity
and memory and what that even means not
just how we keep our heart pumping or
neurons firing
there's also the question of having one
continuous stream of consciousness like
in the star
trek transport or paradox it is easy
enough to imagine resurrecting someone
from a stab wound or gunshot that
damaged a vital organ or caused them to
run out of blood
indeed this is well inside the realm of
what we would already tend to consider
me or medical revival it is also easy to
imagine keeping someone alive if the
injury were to the brain
not their heart or some other organ so
too i mentioned running out of blood
life slowly draining from someone and
that's an analogy i've heard years
describe various types of mental wasting
illnesses like dementia or senility and
that the mind is dripping away even when
the body remains okay
and few of us would argue that a brain
dead body is still alive
if we were keeping the heart pumping and
lungs breathing alternatively a person
who lived with no heartbeat is easy
enough to imagine nowadays
even though we would have deemed such a
creature a nightmare like a vampire or a
zombie in pastimes
of course a zombie is usually portrayed
as not much short of brain dead
probably why they like munching on
brains but it's a term i've heard used
when discussing folks who were
essentially living life in a haze
and that arguably fits someone who keeps
losing their memory is to make room for
more of them
this is a problem we often contemplate
as an issue with live extension
how we extend the capacity of one's
memories to avoid the limits of a
classical human brain
with fixed storage and less than ideal
archiving and recall options
keeping folks memories is obviously
pretty important to restoring their
existence
in brandon sanderson's novel warbreaker
we have a civilization where very
occasionally
folks are brought back to life with no
memory and they are called the returned
but remember nothing of their past life
making it rather debatable if that
person has actually been resurrected
though in the context of the novel it is
apparently the direct action of a higher
power
and many folks worship they returned as
gods so to them at least it is a
secondary issue
the returned have souls and the
implications that their identity and
personality
follow their soul rather than their
memory is also a good reminder that
while nowadays we tend to view memory
and experience
in the form of data as a means for
determining or continuing the identity
of an individual
it is not necessarily the best as an
example if i get amnesia
and forget an event like my wedding and
someone else watches that event
none of us debates who the groom was in
that event or who it happened to
which is handy since like mini grooms my
own recollection of the event is
probably a lot hazier than the folks who
saw the video
but that event even if i'd forgotten it
due to amnesia doesn't necessarily
affect the continuous stream of
existence and consciousness from being
alive
it seems a simple and obvious example
but it's a bit cloudier when we
contemplate ideas like someone digitally
storing their memory
and transferring it to a clone or
android body we would normally say that
the new body was still them or
close enough but we're also not normally
assuming a case of theft
like stealing someone's memories and
leaving them an amnesiac while
transferring those memories
into a robot or clone in that case
leaves us with a question of who is now
the original person or if the transfer
was only partial in one or both cases
this matters a lot for resurrection
technology as we need to be clear on
what the objective is to discuss the
usable technologies
after all if we just meant biological as
identified only by dna
we can clone someone indefinitely with
the same dna
and achieve continuity of identity that
way without continuity of consciousness
given that dna mutates so that cells in
different parts of your body have
slightly different dna from each other
or from when you were born we could
probably do a better job with dna
continuity through artificial means than
natural ones anyway
as we can store it digitally and print
it too or find other lossless formats
cloning someone is one option for
resurrection but it's not a very
complete one
a basic clone is merely a baby who
possesses your dna
folks say that having children is a
pathway to immortality and so a baby
with 100 of your dna
is presumably even more path to
immortality than one possessing a random
50 selection of it
and an erroneous one of that presumably
this also qualifies a type of
resurrection
and a popular one in science fiction
even when it is assumed no memories pass
via cloning
in frank corporate's dune where they
have genetic memory this means of
resurrection
and serial life span is the principle
method of life extension of the genetic
wizards of the bene tilaksu
and how one character duncan idaho is
repeatedly restored to life in later
novels
but even without a memory transfer we
tend to assume a clone would be very
similar to the original person
we cannot actually say how true that
assumption is yet since we don't clone
humans but
twin studies would offer a clue that
said we have very few cases where
identical twins are separate at birth
where we can document how much their dna
really mattered for the development of
their personality
to usefully speculate how much a clone
would resemble its progenitor in
anything but appearance
and even then there are plenty of
factors in the growth of their clone
that could affect its appearance
we can consider this a type of
resurrection if not
ideal and we shouldn't focus on the
assumption memory needs to pass on
directly to qualify
again an amnesiac is usually considered
the same person
and some belief systems that incorporate
reincarnation for instance
assume identity passes from body to body
even though memory does not
nor do we assume you are not you because
your memory of your existence is
imperfect
it is very likely that in centuries to
come possibly even within a decade or so
cameras bandwidth memory and power will
all become cheap and portable enough
that folks will routinely record every
moment of their existence
or even just fairly large chunks of it a
clone watching that recording might be
very like you and indeed might more
clearly remember major life events than
you or i do
we really do not remember our past in
much detail or with much accuracy
we will obviously be discussing ways to
move memory on today but i just want to
emphasize that while doubtless our own
personalities are heavily formed by our
experiences
we probably do not want to assume our
memory alone is the center and sole
aspect of identity
and continuity or restoration it is very
likely that inside the next century or
so medical science will get so good that
we will be able to restore folks
who are thoroughly dead by modern
standards hours after they died
or resurrect people who were frozen
after death for centuries
there are limitations this we will get
to in a bit and one of those
restoring damaged memory which is why we
are focusing on whether memory is really
crucial to our identity
again it seems like it should be a
component of our identity but maybe not
the entirety of it
as one more example if it turned out
folks could only keep a couple centuries
worth of memories in their heads
then if science lets us keep the body
constantly replenished someone might
live thousands of years but only
remember the last century or two
or maybe the last thousand but the most
recent century best and the most recent
decade better
if memories getting replaced with
something more like a half-life
rather than a recording that overwrote
the oldest memory with the news
is this the same person in many ways yes
and this notion of identity that of
continuity is central to john locke's
philosophy of identity
for those who don't know john locke was
a famous british philosopher in the 17th
century and his political writings were
one of the biggest influences on the
american founding fathers
however his writing on the topic of
personal identity interests us today
as one way to think of resurrection and
to gauge a method's level of success at
achieving it
is to ask if the personal identity of
the individual being resurrected was
maintained
which raises the equally tricky question
of what identity is
especially the identity of a person we
have many definitions or explanations
for that but lox is probably the most
familiar for modern speculations on the
topic
lock did not feel identity was founded
on the physical substance or sore
but unconsciousness or memory and we
have already discussed some of the
problems with this approach
the two big ones are forced that you can
make an imperfect copy of someone and
claim they were a continuation of the
original
and point out that the original was
constantly undergoing change including
loss or distortion of memory
indeed your copy may be a cleaner copy
than the nominal original
as if i make two copies of me both
identical with memories
and freeze one for 20 years the one that
experienced those 20 years is a much
worse copy of me than the frozen one
seemed as if i copied a sheet of paper
twice set one inside safe box for
decades while making you appeared serial
copies of the other
war memory alone how he judged identity
a clone of someone complete with their
memories made one minute after they
signed their will
and kept on ice should have a cleaner
claims their property
than that person does if they live for
some decades
indeed that clone would have a
legitimate claim to nullify any wills
made after its creation
and second that personal identity gets
rather dubious if i make two
simultaneous versions of someone
who are sane and who are demonstrably
that same original person
either their memories or personality
aren't perfect matches
i don't care what philosophy says i'm
still me if i forget a whole year of my
life
any definition that says otherwise is
simply wrong
and the same if i undergo a significant
personality change
of course we often think of such events
as rebirths or new lives
and while we say that in a metaphorical
context these days
it doesn't mean it isn't valid either
after all everything to do with identity
is pretty metaphorical and metaphysical
we have three major reasons why all this
matters in our conversation today first
if resurrection is the restoration of a
person it matters a lot how we define
what a person is
and what specific things need restoring
to achieve that continuity of the person
second a lot of the techniques will not
produce either a perfect copy
or a unique one so a mouse a lot of
either of those are necessary for
determining if the resurrection was
successful
are you still you and you once more if
you are missing a memory
inside a cloned body inside a robot
entirely digital
accidentally have some of someone else's
memories too or he made two of you
after all a resurrection is arguably
twice as successful
if it accidentally made two copies third
we need to consider a given method in
contemplating all more duties or rights
with the resurrected person
and this will lead us into discussing
roku's basilisk
vocals basilisk is an a causal thought
experiment an example of a method by
which a person can influence the past
before they existed without a time
machine
that's principally what it's about but
it has taken on more discussion and
thoughts since then
how can an entity influence the past
before it ever exists
the usual notion is that a super
intelligent machine can develop the
technology to restore personal life
and thus he can make a copy of anyone
and torture to death
restore it do it again and again again
this is already a pretty horrifying
potential application of resurrection
technologies
but the a causal concept here is that
the machine need not be a vicious sadist
to have a motive to do this
although it doesn't hurt if we accept
the premise that such a machine's rise
is inevitable then anyone who attempts
to prevent that rise
could be discouraged from that by
reasoning that such a machine could
restore them to
life much like freezing people which we
discussed earlier this year
one way to get the technology to restore
people when you don't have it yet
is to develop the technology to wait
until you do or to free someone
this goes the other direction and
assumes at some point in the future
the technology to restore people will be
so good we won't need a well-preserved
frozen brain to work from
now roku's basilisk argues that such a
machine has a reason to torture
resurrected copies of people
in the future in order to influence
people existing today to assist in its
eventual creation
or at least not to interfere with them
there are a lot of reasons why this is
nonsense but that's not really the main
point
as a thought experiment it works just
fine in establishing a way
in which you could influence the past
prior to your existence without time
travel
thought experiments don't actually have
to be particularly probable to be valid
for contemplation
though it is a bit of a stretch since
you could also argue parents would
rather have a child who could take care
of them in their old age
rather than dump them in the worst out
of care facilities they could find
and thus have a murder to treat their
child well and bring about their
existence as a prosperous and ethical
entity
so a super-intelligent machine can
resurrect the dead as a reward for good
behavior or to punish bad behavior
this also leads the notion that in a
distant future everyone will be
resurrected by sufficiently advanced
technology
the notion being that you can reassemble
any broken object by tracking its pieces
backward in time by calculation
so we could open up some historical
figures grave and raise them from the
dead by examining their skull
centuries later this might take a lot of
calculation
but hey computers double in power every
couple years
so eventually we would be able to do
that right wrong superintelligent
machines will doubtless be capable of
many wonders and terrors including
resurrecting the recently dead
or sustaining life for a time longer
than we enjoy now
but it is not possible to perfectly
reassemble something centuries gone past
by back calculating where all the atoms
wore it is just not possible to create a
computer big enough to calculate atomic
trajectories of an entire planet back
centuries like that
even ignoring quantum uncertainty and
its apparent randomness
which we'll get to in a bit and remember
this is me saying that a computer that
big is impossible
and we have casually discussed turning
the entire solar systems into computers
before
or whole galaxies so we're not just
being lazy about how big we can scale
things up in the future
you die and get buried and something
comes and eats your brain
exhaling and excreting bits of it which
other things will further consume
absorb and scatter cremating someone
ends any chance of putting them back
together again within minutes of that
act
no matter how much computation you throw
at it decay begins in minutes but decay
is a lot different than random motions
of incineration
or material is being carried off as food
so a regular burial
can probably permit a solid restoration
of an individual for many days
and more preservative acts like
cryogenics extend that time frame out a
lot further
this is why it matters how much we care
about how perfect that restoration needs
to be
because if someone puts a bullet through
someone's brain it is probably possible
to back calculate where a lot of the
bits and pieces were
and we probably do not need atomic
precision as neurons are much bigger
than atoms in the same way cities are
bigger than bricks
with decent enough preservation though
it only requires nanotechnology to get
in and repair the damage
and sufficient computing and detection
gear to assess and calculate the repairs
needed
this is technology i would expect to be
developed inside the next century or so
we probably have a lot of margin for
error for recreating someone given that
a perfect copy of someone can only ever
be of a single
instant anyway and not even that given
that signals propagate your brain much
slower than light travels which is still
not instantaneous
meaning the various neurons in your
brain have already changed their state
before another neuron receives a signal
from them
and this instantly does not defeat
roku's basilisk in and of itself
an ethical person can be swayed by what
is done to another person
so while we may not need to be worried
about what some monstrous super ai might
do to us personally in the future via
resurrection
it could threaten to torture or offer to
reward other people besides us
and achieve the same level of threat but
there are plenty of other decent
arguments against this thought problem
of course that's only in the present
future folks are likely have plenty of
options for storing or preserving their
minds
such as mind uploading or digital
archiving and even nowadays it's
somewhat possible by freezing
i personally can't really avoid the
warrior what a roko's basilisk ai might
do to me because i would like my mind
extended indefinitely
and would like to be frozen if i died
tomorrow which means some future
benevolent or malevolent super ai
does have a threat to dangle over my
head and probably would to most folks
alive now and in the future are prior to
its hypothetical existence
we can also posit technologies that get
around the whole issue time travel or
observations of previous times being the
most obvious
again though we also have that question
of how close is close enough given that
our brains change from moment to moment
as do all bodies
there are countless versions of you that
wore from the moment you were born to
the day you die
and the moving of a single atom to a
single different place so even a million
of them
should generally have an effect far
tinier than the changes brought about by
every single thing in your life you
could even recognize as being an event
even just whether or not there were five
pieces or six pieces of cereal
on your spoon for the seventh bite you
took this morning
and this brings in the whole concept of
multiverses of course since the mini
world's interpretation of quantum
mechanics holds that there are two
distinct universes for any given event
so one where you ate five pieces and one
with six
indeed it argues there is a separate
universe for the one where you ate five
and another where you also ate five but
did so a microsecond later
or were you ate five but a single atom
of uranium decayed in the earth's core
now
that did so a thousand years from now in
another universe
i don't think we could have any sane
definition of the word year that didn't
include all those versions as the same
person
this offers a different version of
identity or individuality
influenced by memories but not reliance
on them which is that a person is
fundamentally their personality
or behavior and how they respond to
things
of course that is not limited to just
the immediate moment that there are
virtually infinite number of minor
variations of you that are basically
still
you two atoms rearranged in your pinky
finger cannot possibly be considered a
cause for contemplation of separate
identities
but even at war there should be an
infinite number of times various atoms
arrange into a perfect copy of you
in a universe that is infinite in space
and time
this is quantum resurrection and it
relies on no technology or conscious
effort by some person or agency
in a big enough sample size any event
that can happen will happen
and a bigger one will happen again
whether the sample is very large in size
like rolling a couple million dice or
large in recurrence like rolling a cup
of dice
a million times the universe is a very
big place
especially if we mean multiverses or
beyond the observable universe
see our episode on parallel universes
and alternate realities for a thorough
discussion of that
and again we don't need a perfect copy
we do not need that one in 10 to 10
trillion
chance that atoms should have aligned
perfectly as they are in you now
or will be in a moment or next year just
close enough to be you
again but even if we did need that level
of perfect replication
in an infinite universe it will happen
and will happen
an infinite number of times too see our
infinite and probability issues episode
for some examples of exactly how crazy
this sort of thing can get
that close enough really does matter too
because we mostly want to resurrect
other people to interact with them
making the definition of
personality-based prints beyond behavior
more pertinent i can't resurrect john
locke or benjamin franklin to ask them
their views on things because they are
too long dead for the computer to back
calculate their atoms
but we could only guess the simulation
authenticity by comparing their behavior
to record behavior of theirs
and reaction to historical events we
could probably do a decent job at making
something close enough to fool others
and we have more of a court history on
most folks living nowadays than on them
all those photos all those posts and
tweets all those internet sources
databases of purchases from online
stores etc probably make a very potent
forensic tool for recreating someone
even if you lack a copy of their brain
in a decent state of preservation it is
strange to think of it but even without
bringing multiverses and eternity into
play
there is a good chance you will be back
again one day
and we bring multiverses or simulated
realities into play
then you will be back again one day and
you already have been before
and we've had this conversation before
you and i and we'll have it again
and again and again
we'll get to the schedule in just a
moment but first i want to note that
this is the fifth anniversary
of when we switched over to doing weekly
episodes for the show and i often think
of the roughly 20 episodes produced in
the year and a half before that
as more like a full runner to the show
rather than part of it
it's also when i really started thinking
of it as a show and partially because
that's when folks started asking me how
to start their own shows or vlogs
i've been asked more this year than all
the others combined though about how to
start a show or if you should
and my advice remains the same give it a
try
whether it's writing a book or painting
a mural or starting a garden or doing a
vlog
you won't know if it's for you unless
you give it a try
and my only usual caution on that is to
check your reasons first
you will probably do a lot better at
writing or vlogging or what have you
if your first love is the content you
want to share and gideon shared
not if it is that you love folks who are
listening to you
write a book because you have a story to
tell not because you want to be a
bestseller
but a lot of folks are looking for new
paths in life and i entirely encourage
that
it's a very different sort of
resurrection av birth than what we
looked at today but very much as real of
one
and this last year has left a lot of
folks feeling a need for a change
i'd always encourage folks to be looking
to try out new experiences
grab new skills and reinvent themselves
better than before
if you're interested in learning new
skills then skillshare is a great place
to do that
and they have a ton of useful classes on
virtually every topic and that includes
video editing if you're thinking about
giving youtube or vlogging a try
and i'd recommend ally abdul's video
editing class from beginner to youtuber
ali is a great example of someone who
took an area of expertise
he's a doctor and turned it into a show
and he also does some great lifestyle
and productivity videos too
perhaps you're trying to adjust to
working a new environment or just
looking to pick up some new skill or
hobby
skillshare has a course for it whether
you're a beginner
a pro a dabbler or a master skillshare

so today we looked at restoring life and
next week we'll be asking what
intelligent life is
as we discuss sentience sapience and
notions of consciousness
then we'll close the month out with our
monthly livestream q a on sunday
march 28th at 4 pm eastern time then
we'll jump into april with a look at how
artificial intelligence might be used in
government
or how it might govern before returning
to the fermi paradox on april 8th for
the long requested topic of drake's
equation for searching for
extraterrestrial intelligence or
