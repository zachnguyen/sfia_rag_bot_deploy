When contemplating universes with a 4th physical 
dimension, one of the problems we have is that  
gravity would weaken sharply as it should 
drop in strength inverse-cube to distance,  
rather than inverse square like here. While 
it's hard to say how big such universes might  
be if expanding like ours, or how well galaxies 
or stars would form, it is virtually impossible  
to have a stable orbit or habitable planets in 
4D that’s not a perfect circular orbit, since  
an object varying in orbit just 10% in distance, 
from .9 to 1.1 radii, would experience roughly  
double the sunlight and gravity at perihelion 
than aphelion, guaranteeing that even if the  
planets wasn’t perturbed, ejected, or swallowed 
by its sun, it would still be roasted and frozen.  
Particularly as it would need to be vastly closer 
to its parent star to get enough light. See our  
episode “higher dimensional aliens” for more 
discussion. But as best as we can tell, stable  
orbits are effectively impossible in 4D, 2D, 
or any higher dimension, good thing we’re in 3D
