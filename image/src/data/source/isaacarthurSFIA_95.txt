Can The Moon Keep An Atmosphere?
When talking about terraforming planets like
Mars it's common to say a planet needs a lot
of gravity to keep an atmosphere and not a
lot of heat, and to say our own Moon couldn’t
keep an atmosphere itself.
This isn’t exactly wrong but misses that
a number of things strip gasses off a planet
and that normal temperature and the planet’s
escape velocity isn’t the main one.
Generally air molecules, nitrogen and oxygen,
move a few hundred meters per second, non-coincidentally
around the speed of sound, whereas the escape
velocity of Earth is 30 times this, and the
Moon is 5-6 times this speed.
If we dumped an Earth-like atmosphere on the
Moon, it would not instantly go flying off
into space, particularly if we also gave it
a strong magnetosphere to deflect incoming
solar wind.
You would still need some containment, like
very large domes or a transparent sphere to
keep air from leaking out on longer timelines
and shield from UV, but the leakage would
be slow… which answer the question…
