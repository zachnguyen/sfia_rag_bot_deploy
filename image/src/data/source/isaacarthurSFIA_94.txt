Our sun is halfway through its life and yet 
only a third as old as the Galaxy. We would  
expect the galaxy to be littered with dead stars 
but in truth they're not terribly common. The  
overwhelming majority of stars are smaller than 
our Sun and will live many times the current age  
of the Universe. Most will become white dwarfs, 
we estimate roughly 10 billion have so far,  
and many of these merge or absorb enough mass to 
detonate as Type 1 Supernovae, leaving no remnant,  
or perhaps a zombie Star. Only about 3% of stars 
are big enough to go supernova instead of first  
becoming a white dwarf. These mostly leave neutron 
stars, perhaps a billion exist in this galaxy,  
and we estimate roughly a tenth of that 
number as black holes. Of the hundreds of  
billions of stars in this galaxy, perhaps 
100 million are black holes, and even the  
huge one at the galactic core makes up just 
a few millionths of the total galactic mass.
