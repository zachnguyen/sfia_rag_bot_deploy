A Hegemonizing Swarm is a living weapon, or
self-replicating machine, which seeks to turn
every last available bit of matter into more
of itself or a desired construct.
Examples can include grey goo, a paperclip
maximizer, the Borg from Star Trek, the Replicators
from Stargate SG-1, or arguably even regular
biological life itself.
A hegemonizing swarm might also be a runaway
terraforming device, trying to turn all matter
in the galaxy into space habitats, artificial
planets, computronium, or giant weapon and
defense installations.
Whatever its end goal is, it is a relentless
swathe of destruction, like some killing cloud
descending on a world to disassemble everything
and destroy all that was.
A hegemonizing swarm is usually assumed to
be apocalyptic, and if it has any personality
at all, to be callous, stupid, unwavering,
or unwilling to show mercy or negotiate.
However, as we explored in our episode, the
Paperclip Maximizer, there may develop novel
variations of their goals or personality.
