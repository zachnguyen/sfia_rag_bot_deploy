good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink
and a snack though we'll take a break
about halfway through too with all that
said
welcome and let's get started
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
our monthly live stream with science
future with isaac arthur and i am isaac
arthur
and uh my wife was just telling me
before we got started this is the
roughly two year anniversary of us doing
the live stream so this is
number 23 we skipped a couple occasions
two years now doing live streams and
hopefully they've gotten a bit better
i we'll get your questions in just a
moment and uh
just go ahead and give those to the mods
and they'll bring them up to me as soon
as we can we have a couple of them from
last time
and we'll go ahead and get started yes
thank you
isaac this is sarah i think you forgot
to mention that i was going to be
reading the questions to you today yes
my wife sarah whose voice you're hearing
is one of the other questions
um so we had some questions that we were
unable to get to the
in august and i'm going to start with
one from aka
isaac arthur greetings speaking of
building megastructures what do you
think would economically make more sense
hunt and mine asteroids or mine the moon
in the new
or mine the moon in the near future uh
that kinda depends on where your target
is
for actually building the various
megastructures
we'll be looking at that more in the
returns of the moon episode on october
1st on our next episode
and then the uh that's from the becoming
a planetary species
uh series episode three episode five
which i believe is late october
or early november will cover the
asteroid mining in oklahoma's case
early on when you're building mostly
around earth there are gonna be some
near-earth asteroids not the ones in the
belt but the near-earth asteroids and
there are tens of thousands of those
that might have a lower delta v or be
more accessible to reach and bring into
orbit
than the moon but if you're doing heavy
construction um
of orbital settlements around the planet
you probably would get most of that from
the moon
the asteroids are likely to be more
orbital sediment set up there
or used for like lagrange points or
cyclos which was something we'll cover
in the mars episode cyclos being the
type of way of doing a fast spaceship
between mars and earth or other planets
we have a question from chris as well
how are we determining the mass of whole
galaxies to detect
dark matter seems that it would be hard
to pin down an accurate mass for so many
stars
dust and rocks this is my first question
thanks in advance
uh there's actually an example this is
how we found dark man in the first place
as we were determining the mass of the
galaxies
mostly by how much they poured on each
other gravitationally and it wasn't
coming up as enough
same we'd start looking through and
seeing how much dust absorption there
was to try to estimate the mass of
regular matter
and if you're gonna oh it's probably
just interstellar dust lots and lots but
not forming nostalgia
or maybe even a ton of black holes but
as we got better at detecting things
like that we started seeing there was
nowhere near enough mass
as to how we actually detect them all
the galaxies are moving away from each
other with a few exceptions like
andromeda and us
and we can kind of calculate how much
gravity versus how much
push away from us they seem to be
getting and for that we can estimate
both the actual mass involved of dark
matter
and dark energy and that's basically how
we do that
very nice thank you um
we had a question about your benevolent
aliens video
from eric malsbeau and he said
do you deem it plausible and possible to
ask extraterrestrial beings for help
regarding major issues on earth
and if yes how well the question is
always if they're out there and as you
guys know i
tend to assume that they are not at
least nowhere near us um
but obviously they are and they are
listening i don't know they'd be very
likely to respond
uh given that they don't really seem to
be very involved they might have some
kind of prime directive thing going on
or extreme case of apathy
so it is one of those examples where if
you're asking them
presumably people ask them before and uh
they presumably have the technology to
be a little bit better than just
listening to radio waves but there might
be a way to do it i don't know if we've
actually ever sent out a radio wave just
saying
hey we'd like to talk we'd like some
help we sent out hey we'd like to talk
kind of messages but
could you send us a blueprint for fusion
maybe if we did that we'd get a reply
it's hard to say but i would tend to
assume that they probably would not be
in position to answer us simply because
they don't exist anywhere near enough to
us to do that
okay do we have questions from we do yes
we have some questions
coming in at the moment and so i'm going
to start with one
from gamespot live
what do you think about larger life on
venus
we had that phosphine gas trace in the
atmosphere that was the big news for the
last couple
of weeks um and we talked about briefly
in this week's episode
um the usual thought is that if you're
drinking
life forms on venus and they're in the
atmosphere they'd have to be
either very tiny microbes they could
float around like dust in the atmosphere
or they'd have to be living blimps which
is potentially doable
you could have um you know a pathway
that resulted in things
expanding your cells to be basically
living blimps in which case they might
be very big if they're going to be smart
but size is often not an advantage
either
and so and there's the other thing if
they're big enough then we probably well
i wouldn't say we'd spot them yet we
really haven't done enough on venus we
will say we could have spot something
even the size of a blue whale
but if you got really big ones we'd
probably tend to see those and maybe
already you've seen them
but then there's gotta be a whole chain
of uh
your food chain for these things to be
living on a whole ecological niche and
that should have things filling up in
various size ranges too
um i tend to assume we're not going to
find any life on venus and
if we do you know with the phosphine gas
for instance
what's the most likely way it could have
gotten on the venus well it could have
come in on a meteorite
number of times it could have evolved
there naturally or it could have come in
on one of our space probes because we
don't really bother sterilizing those as
well as we should
uh all we're going to take is a handful
of those microbes to survive the journey
from earth
which is entirely plausible and then to
have survived
and at least one of them survives and
venus divides and then
even 10 years later you know microbes
reproduce very quickly
so if it does turn out to be microbial
life on venus i'd say there's probably
50 50 odds that its origin was worth
okay so we have a question here from
isaac bradeau
hey isaac i hope you are having a good
weekend which one do you think is more
likely
faster than light travel or faster than
light communications
um i am having a good weekend you have
an excellent first name
um let's see we usually say faster like
communication is the more likely just
because there's a little bit
more wiggle room in special relativity
and general relativity permit things
like that
um you
are not necessarily engaging in time
travel to transmit a message
a distance farther than light could have
carried it you know that's
the other aspect of that is if you are
doing something like a wormhole for
instance it's obviously a lot easier to
make a warm whole mouth that's just big
enough to get
you know a laser beam through than to
actually fill a person with
and you can also if there's a lot of
noise from something like that there
probably would be a ton of noise you
know trying to go through a wormhole is
like going through a black hole
and so you have a lot of noise and
interference that's probably going to be
in that
and it's a lot easier to get through a
you know a signal that's just being
pumped at a very slow amplitude
uh than it is to get something like a
person alive and intact
so fast and light travel and
communication i tend to think neither
one of them's allowed for the same
reasons
but for a practical standpoint i would
tend to guess that
the communication thing would be much
easier possible exception of the
alcubierre warp drive and again that
relies on negative matter and energy but
that is more of a move object kind of
thing in which case
moving a small object with a little data
chip on it's probably a lot easier than
moving
a you know a spaceship but with people
on it but
either way that's probably the case
underlying emphasis
we went to arrive alive and intact yeah
yeah that is one of the
key issues a lot of time on these things
live intact and back though the way
oh yes that too um so speaking of alive
we have a question from
will life evolve everywhere in the uni
excuse me will life evolve everywhere in
the universe where
suitable conditions are available for a
sufficient amount of time
yes um but the keyboard there is
suitable conditions we don't actually
know what the suitable conditions for
life emerging actually are and it might
be i mean it could literally be that
there
are none that we are you know a
byproduct of you know a higher level
of reality be a simulator or deity or
that we are the freak anthropic odds of
one in 10 to the 100th
of them being life in any universe and
even smaller for ours
we do not know what the coincidental
odds are for life popping up
it could be as has been suggested that
um
a tendency of molecules to kind of put
themselves into a heat dissipation mode
which you might remember some articles
last year might tend to result in
metabolic process very basic metabolic
process forming
with chemicals into what would be basic
life if that were the case the odds go
up an awful lot
but again we do not know how likely life
is and indeed we can't even say if
like if we pinned down where life
originated on earth within 10 million
years or something like that
we still couldn't say that life had
evolved that fast here and with other
places
and we also couldn't say it hasn't
evolved since then because it might be
something that's really common but the
first time something gets there and gets
some degree of complexity
any new ones any new events of that
origin of life
would just get swept away as being too
primitive compared to what is already
existing
until we actually can really model that
and produce that lab well and we've come
nowhere near that
i've seen some cisco modeling on it that
is
not very good that we just don't know
what those odds are so
it's just impossible to say right now
how likely it is but i would say that
whatever it is if you're in a place
where it's likely to occur and give
enough time it will do so
a question from stay cross when do you
think the first
luna aluminum will be produced uh luna
aluminum
yes okay um
within the next 10 to 20 years not
necessarily in bulk though but that
would be one of those experiments where
you want to be doing is is setting a
kiln there to actually operate
um you know there's so much aluminum on
the surface of of
the moon and such a power intensive
process that's like ideal for the
basic kind of solar and nuclear process
we won't be seeing about a good moon
base
and aluminum is very light easy to work
with it's very energy intense to make is
about its only downside compared to
steel
but it's probably going to be a lot
easier to produce in bulk than steel
so any kind of process where we're
trying to look to create large amounts
of oxygen for instance
probably going to come in combination
with something of a
furnace you know for iron steel or
aluminum because you'll be burning out
those oxides to produce the metal
and the oxygen so we have some
experiments going for that already
in terms of oxygen production the next
step would be to try to see if we could
produce metals that way and get those
up in terms of lower scale model
production
um five years plus or miles from the
first moon base
and that depends on how much mean by
large we have a question from
channel regular albert jackinson hi
isaac there seems to be a lot of
dystopian or utopian societies portrayed
in science fiction
but ones that are less extreme seem to
be less prevalent
why do you think that is um
narrative bias stories that are uh
stories that are
not exciting are not published or not
red do not get sequels
um you know they're all there was
actually an
entire genre of fiction or i should say
sub-genre almost each one that is just
about day-to-day ordinary life and i
actually tend to be more fond of that a
lot of these shows and the exciting bits
but even then you if you have a society
that's basically a
genuine utopia as opposed to the utopia
on the surface with evil cracks
underneath
or is not dystopian just maybe a little
bit of bureaucracy and problems
that's maybe not the sort of story
that's going to have interesting heroes
running around it
but we do get examples of that kind of
fiction though um
artemis sorry not autonomous um oh
that's not a bad example uh mart the
motion by andy weir who also did the
book of artemis
um there's no dystopia or utopia going
on there it's a regular
life uh it's just that here you have one
person who
has gotten them so stranded and
everyone's going out of their way to
help him you know that's a very
utopian look at society everyone really
does buckle down and try to help him
once he
makes his presence clear and uh so you
can't have
fiction like that but when you're
looking at civilizations in detail
for the fiction is usually because you
want to focus in on that civilization as
part of the plot and of course that
means it's probably very dystopian or it
has
probably to get fixed uh i suspect for
us in the future the reality will lie
not just somewhere in the middle but
many places in the middle because
there's only so many different societies
over time and space
and some of them will be a lot better
than others but i suspect most of them
will be on the whole
hopefully relatively boring
well if they get too boring they won't
be able to write any more books about
them and
then they'd all be copying one another
so well the nice thing about science
fiction is supposed to be about the
future and there's always more of the
future no matter how far ahead of the
future you are
very true we have a question from jack
bad boy could an advanced civilization
harvest gravitational waves to use as
energy
also could gravitational waves be
forcing the universe apart
and thus be dark energy there's often a
lot of discussion about whether or not
uh
dark energy is kind of the anti-force
for the repulsive force for gravity but
it doesn't fit
the ones we have negative forces for or
i should say opposite forces for
those act exactly the same only the
opposite direction
near the electromagnetic force or you're
a strong nuclear force
dark energy does not act exactly
opposite of gravity save in regards to
the fact that it pushes
space apart it's not pushing objects
apart it's growing space that's the key
thing about dark energy
when what we say is dark energy and why
we call it dark energy is because
there's a certain amount of energy
associated to a volume of space
so a new piece of space suddenly pops up
somewhere there's a little bit energy
there
what's happening here is not
gravitational force exerting on things
it's
just new bits of space popping up
randomly everywhere at once at least we
think randomly we can't really tell yet
so is it possibly related to gravity oh
i'd not be the least bit surprised if in
the final theory that you know grand
unified theory which i'll hear as much
about these days
that actually got gravity unified with
the other forces also included dark
energy
and was closely related but as them
actually being
like the opposite force i'd say no as
the horizon for energy
potentially i mean it'd be an awesome
force if it was there because it appears
to violate conservation of energy
uh which is always one of those things
you have to be kind of careful saying
because it depends on what we mean by
violate conservation of energy but we've
known about
energy conservation violations since
general relativity came out
um the question is does it actually do
in any way that's useful to us it's a
little bit like vacuum energy
um you know you can't get energy out of
a cold lukewarm
tub because there's nothing to move it
around with it has to be hot or you have
to have something colder to draw the
energy out of
vacuum energy is very similar and dark
energy is likely to be the same kind of
case where there's a lot of energy there
but
how do you actually go about removing
ants and
usually about the only way you can come
up to think about how to do that with
modern science and techniques would be
to take some
very long spring uh two billion light
years long or so
and uh stretched out with dark energy
and pull it back in and
maybe gain a little bit of energy on
that process but that's about the only
thing i've ever hold really come up with
an idea
i like this uh this title it says
blueberry lane
somebody uh says hi isaac how much
further would automation need to improve
to make the world
borderline post scarcity how much more
automation
yes how much further automation
it kind of depends on what sort of
automation um
and always depends a lot on black post
scarcity we do have an episode coming up
on that again
either late october early november um
becoming a post-scarcity
and kardashev one civilization which are
not necessarily the same thing
uh there's a lot of things that can make
you post scarcity but the two big ones
we tend to focus on the show
are abundant and replaceable energy
renewable energy
um or much much better automation
and in fact butter automation will give
you automatically renewable energy
because you just can
fabricate solar panels for a dollar a
square foot or something like that so it
gets so cheap to make them that it's
effectively abundant
um but uh
i would say that if we get to the point
that
maybe our twitter production from
automation maybe doubles about what is
right now that would probably be enough
kickers over
again it's so tied to what we actually
get better at automating specifically
again the solar panel example or mining
uh
and then keyed into that um do we
actually have a sustainability on that
because
you're not post-scarcity eeg a lack of
scarcity if you actually still have a
core scarcity of
energy which is of course the big
driving fuel for everything the next
question is from abi najib
is a city inside an asteroid like in the
expanse
possible and will you make an episode
about it
we have talked about doing that inside
asteroids before and it's actually
one of those things i tend to like to
make sure to raise a point on
sometimes they'll show you a hollowed
out asteroid where the asteroid is
spinning around
and they say look it's it's a good spin
and gravity habitat all we do is hollow
it out and spin it around
if you did that to an actual asteroid
you would rip it apart
uh the layer you're standing on has
effectively that much gravity pushing
outwards so
it would be falling apart as though it
was under one g of gravity or a little
bit more because it's four thousand when
your feet are
and most of those things you could take
apart just spinning them a little bit
faster they could not handle that level
of rotation maybe the metal
maybe the metallic ones if you very
carefully redid it but they probably
still repropulse
the key with an asteroid you want to
hollow it out and use it as a city
is to call it out put a cylinder inside
it
like like a thermos lining and then put
another cylinder nest
inside that that you spin around so you
have a spinning habitat that's
inside it but it does not spin the the
you know the soda can is spinning
the rockets inside is not and that works
perfectly fine it's very cheap source of
uh
you know shielding um you just burr into
the asteroid which is simplistic enough
and you build your habitat but you do
not hollow it out and live on the inside
of that as
well that as to realism though very high
um
not so much for the orbital sediments
around earth because they're your
trucking the man are in
um and you have to pay the energy bill
for moving giga tons of raw material you
don't really need
but in films like the asteroids there
are around a million of them
at least that are big enough to hollow
out and kind of recombine into making
like a
at least a planet sized habitat if not
an audio cylinder
b-51 bomber asks you recently had an
episode about the phosphorus problem
is it possible to manufacture more
phosphorus if a future civilization
needs to alleviate a major shortage
yes the uh and i think we mentioned that
in that episode
um none of the stuff that goes on inside
stars is something we actually have a
problem replicating these days
i think that's a mistake people make
about fusion sometimes is they say oh
well you know it's very hard to do
because you have to replicate the you
know what's going on inside the center
of a stall
no that would be easy it's very easy to
replicate the circumstance inside the
center of the stalls
uh that's not enough you know you think
about how much energy the sun gives off
we say it's a 10 to 26 watts but then
you have to keep in mind that if it's 10
to 26 watts that's giving off and it's
about 10 to 31 that's weighing
that means that a kilogram of the stuff
is giving off not even a milliwatt
you know you'd need tons of material
that's in the center of the sun
just to give you enough energy to light
a light bulb
um it's because that does it for
billions of years so it's very energy
efficient but not very energy intense
we have to do way better than that to
make fusion the same applies to things
like supernova those are very extreme
circumstances that are going on there
even compared to the insides of stars
but
what's creating that silicon just the
thing's about to blow up and then that
silicon can absorb a neutron
presumably not positive about the
process silicon absorbs a neutron and
turns into phosphorus and that's our
source for phosphorus so if we take a
bunch of silicon 30 and ram it with
neutrons
then we got phosphorus we've got things
we use sorts of neutrons like uranium
um you know breed or react or same is
how we make plutonium but the simple
answer that question is
we can make phosphorus that way but only
if the phosphorus
is valuable enough to us that it's
basically as valuable as plutonium
or some of the other things we make
we're using breeder reactors
so that would require either a massively
cheap source of neutrons
um which is possible or a desperate
desperate necessity for phosphorus
and uh i think that by and large
we would probably only end up doing that
after we've exhausted everything else
the solar system probably including
taking apart
gas giants mr k says
what's your view on the wow signal what
do you think it was
noise or reflection i know the wow
signal you know certainly got a lot of
people's attention got a lot interested
in setting which i'm glad for
but you have to keep in mind a lot of
these things
if you're trying to send a message to
people across space you know maybe it's
an accidental blip of their own stuff
that was otherwise being secret but
you're not going to have a signal that's
you know a few bites and doesn't repeat
itself because you know if anyone's
going to be listening
you blast that thing over and over and
over again a repeating pattern they
cannot possibly be confused that is
artificial origin
or you send something very long that's
still orderly you know clearly
artificial that repeats cg
wikipedia or something strained down
rosetta stone that you just keep
repeating
over and over again and you know in a
background signal like the first
thousand digits of pi
you know they know that's artificial
then
um and so the only alternative is that
that was
uh an accident right well it was an
accident from a nearby spaceship that
just happened to give off that signal
and nothing else
it's also just plausible assume that it
was reflected off of you know any number
of other objects in our solar system
or moon a satellite there are so many
options for
how i could have accidentally produced
that signal and very little reason to
think that that was an intentional
attempt to contact us
[Applause]
channel regular jonathan asks do you
have any idea for a sci-fi
fantasy setting or story that you would
willingly tell us
add-on question from staff is there a
chance that we'll see any books written
by isaac
um probably yes
for something non-fiction uh i was
actually thinking about writing a
formula paradox
uh book or a collection of essays this
year but that was last year i was
thinking about that that was before
getting married yeah
that kind of got me a little bit
distracted fiction wise it's not that i
don't have plenty of thoughts potential
stories
i actually routinely share them with
folks and tell them to go ahead and
write them up
it's more that i don't know that i'm
very good with character dialogue i
think almost every character i like
whether they're a hero
or a minor character or the bad guy all
kind of
tend to come off like super villains or
chess masters
or wouldn't exposition things just tell
you about the backstory
i like creating words and settings i'm
not that interested in writing the plots
of the stories for them
but i might give my hand to you i might
give a shot at some point but
non-fiction
probably yes at some point i mean when
you get around to it the show is
basically just
essays that i i put out that i put a
video on top of it narrates
those could just easily be bundled into
books and i think at this point i'd be
up to
well let's see 300 episodes at uh 5 000
words apiece
it's actually over 300 350 1.5 million
awards
there's probably several decent-sized
books so
i think you know the fantasy doorstop
was like 4 000.
john hopkins says could we use nanobots
to grow
megastructures potentially if you can
get nanobots that you can actually work
to that
although one thing that i like to warn
people off with nanotechnology and
webcams we see them in science fiction
always as
you know a single breed think of nano
machines
as more like a complex ecosystem with
thousands of different varieties that
are all working in tune
ranging from the smallest little things
you can make and transmit
to much much bigger ones that might be
the size of an entire cell
or even you know visible to the naked
eye uh
think of nanotechnology never as
individual
resemblers but an entire spectrum of
them an entire ecosystem them and then
also keep in mind that just because you
can do something at a tiny scale
does not mean it's advantageous by and
large if you want to produce a
sheet of metal you are much better off
using a great big stupid kiln that's
automated a clanking self-advocate
example as opposed to a trillion little
robots that are doing that
you have to get them energy you have to
repair them maintain them they're
fragile
in some cases like if you want to make
things so very big you're going to
incorporate very large things into it bg
vats of
metal we have a
donation from wynton ashley and
his question is you said that some
requirements for a species to be
space-faring
would be curiosity and expansionism what
about a desire for new things places and
experiences
i would tend to say that's curiosity um
you know you look at these things we're
usually talking about in a general way
biologically species should tend to be
curious and expansionist in a general
sense
as i say we're talking about things like
end goals or instrumental goals
i have a desire to survive we say a will
to survive as an organism and
survival of the species would say too
but these aren't programmed into you
these are not
you know asthma-style laws written onto
your brain
they are more an extrapolation of a
number of things that have been
successful
at survival and although still there
um there is no will to survive built
into you as a single loan
do not let yourself be destroyed um
the same thing tends to apply to a
species of civilization
uh i don't know if lois and clark when
they uh lewis and clark excuse me
uh when they were you know exploring the
americas were thinking
one day there'll be a great city on the
bay here and then over here there'll be
a gigantic bridge across the mississippi
in this place called st
louis and my wife's glam because she was
well history me i think i just misnamed
a few places they went to
point b and they were into exploration
but people who followed them up were
more into
colonization right and some people just
want to get a phone by themselves and
they want to be away from cities but
then that effect
you know a hundred years later is their
kids and the other folks people go to
that area
uh had built a city you know that's what
we mean is it's not like there's some
overwhelming drive by a person to get
out in space and colonize every war
there is for me
that's like my big end goal get humanity
across the entire galaxy
um but i don't think most people share
that as their day-to-day you know
motivation goal
um and uh
you know for some folks there's gonna be
to explore for some folks to be to run
away
some folks it's gonna be to get away
from civilization uh
or to create a new civilization that
meets their particular preferences and
and desires
and it's the net effect of all these
that kind of statistical average that we
would think
brings people out into space more so a
species might be very curiosity driven
and out there to explore but if they're
very prone to that they're going to want
to help their peers who might want to
follow after them have a slightly easier
time exploring it'll be
out further so they're going to have an
outpost and someone's going to handle
staying there when they're in their off
time and and
now exploring themselves and running
that outpost and a thousand years later
it's a colony you know that's just how
that kind of thing works out
we have a similar question from battle
bunny what odds would you give our
civilization or species to survive the
next 500 years
50 50. there's a thing we use sometimes
in simulation hypothesis it's uh
the principle of indifference it's when
you've got two very plausible options
uh that makes sense and no other were
the obvious scenarios ega yes no
question but you have no way to look at
the data for that
you just assume they're both equal odds
uh if you had three you assume unique
one and three
we could kill ourselves off tomorrow um
we could be in great condition 500 years
from now
my usual thought on these things isn't
that i don't think that we could do it
that we could actually kill ourselves
off or intentionally do it it's just i
don't
tend to think it's very useful to
contemplate those scenarios because
you know if i get struck by meteor
tomorrow i'm dead i'm not really going
to put that into my contingency planning
for a given day
um i don't think we're going to wipe
ourselves out though because
again you can't based off of previous
occasions people have been predicting
for over and over again that we're
eventually going to wipe ourselves out
and we have not
and uh i think that has a little bit to
do with your personal outlook on life if
you're very pessimistic or cynical about
your fellow mankind you're probably
going to assume we're going to die off
if you tend to have a little bit more
faith in humanity then you probably
attend people survive
ask them which one of those views is
right i don't know i do know which one i
subscribe to
so i want to slip in two more questions
here before the break we have
a donation from cozy high and
he is asking are there any near-term
texts that worry you
thanks courtesy for the donation
near-term tips that worry me artificial
intelligence because that we already
have that going on that's the big one
um and in some ways i'm less worried
about
you know i really don't think of skynet
wiping us out that much i really don't
think of machine rebellions going on and
killing ourselves i tend to worry more
about the effect it will have our
civilization when
you know we have all these disruptions
or we start saying
well this robot's pretty smart but it
can't possibly be a person therefore we
can do whatever we want to it
you know that's or we can program to
enjoy whatever we have it doing
that kind of thing worries me because
it's a little bit like animal cruelty
you might say that well this might not
be a person but at the same time
the fact that you're doing it at all if
it isn't the person you're hurting
is is a pretty bad place to be taking
yourself and a civilization so
i tend to worry a lot more about how
we're going to treat fellow humans
if you look at a lot of the sci-fi from
the early
20th century to the mid-20th century
there was a big focus
on the feel that more factories and
automation would mean that we'd start
treating people
like machines um and that's always a bit
of concern there
um then instead of anthropomorphizing
the machines and the people we would
start turning the people into you know
being treated like machines one big car
you know one more cog in the hive
so that tends to be a bit more where ai
is concerned as to other technologies
um automation and artificial
intelligence are the really two big ones
i'd be worried about
um i don't know that anything else
really has potential for extreme
catastrophe at this time but then again
it could be what we call uh we say a
honeypot technology
um honey trap technology you stop
putting your fingers in there and
it's so tasty and tempting that you get
stung by the bees and either you know
the bees are there
or you can't see them and you're
completely you know into this technology
where you see the dangers and it wipes
you out
so um that though i'd say it's the real
one that always voids me is artificial
intelligence
so after that exploration of the
negative side let's take a quick look at
the positive side before moving forward
we have a donation from
tyron beard and he says so glad to catch
a live stream
live while it's live i plug you
everywhere but i must ask
what is our next step forward artificial
intelligence and automation
wait did you just say that that was
negative um
you know the things we always have to
worry the most about are the things that
we have a desire to do for good reasons
when there's something we want to do
that's dangerous and stupid
like uh you know base jumping it's not
not to offend everyone due to base jumps
but
i think everyone knows that's a pretty
dangerous sport
it's very easy to talk people out of
doing that it might be exciting but it's
very dangerous
it's a lot harder to talk people out of
using technology that has so
many advantages and so many potential
advantages for saving lives you know
self-driving cars
when we get them walking we'll save i
think we have 40 000 people dying car
accidents in the united states every
year
that number's probably changed since
i've been looking it up but
40 000 less dead people a year from
self-driving cars
um that would be one example of a very
attractive technology
um people who don't have to spend as
much time
at work so can spend more time with
their family um teachers who can spend
more time one-on-one with the students
because the machines are helping do a
lot of the
simplistic parts of the education um
all those things are very very
attractive and
they are probably very very good for us
and they are also potentially very
dangerous so it's
same with internal combustion engine or
nuclear power or so many others
the danger and the reward is the fact
that there are both of them that make it
such a
concern because the question is can you
rise up the challenge to find a way to
use this safely
or is it going to smack you under and uh
automation
is the one that offers us the biggest
chance of really getting up into space
really having that civilization we all
want where the you know it's the horn of
plenty as it were
and uh so it's that challenge we're
going to have to tackle i think that's
why you focus on it so much otherwise
you could just say
bam that stuff you know dune style but
leo and jihad no
artificial intelligence that's the
problem though is that it's got so many
advantages we get better at that
you probably can't do that all right
we're gonna go ahead and head to break
we'll see in a few minutes
so we'll be taking a quick break and
it's a great chance to grab a drink and
a snack
like i'm doing or get some questions
into our moderators
folks occasionally ask what the process
is for getting those questions in
and the simple version is you put it in
the chat the mods copy and paste those
into a discord window
and sarah reads them off to me they go
roughly in chronological order of being
ass
but many do get skipped if the mods
can't figure out what the question is
asking
if it's too roughly misspelled includes
profanity or is one of our no-go topics
like current politics
sometimes when the audience or mods will
have answered the question too
or was the topic that we're covering in
upcoming episodes and they can't get
skipped for that
our mods are frequently also our script
editors so i have to know if i did or
didn't cover something in an episode
coming up soon
we do prioritize super chats but beyond
that and the aforementioned
we basically get them in the order given
if yours gets skipped it's fine to
resubmit it
but odds are if you've done that twice
it's probably a question i'm not going
to see
instantly i don't see the chat real time
neither does sarah
well i do go back and watch it
afterwards i can't struggle monitoring
our chat and fielding questions
simultaneously
our mods handle that and i can't reply
the chat once the live stream is over
but i do reply to the comments on the
live stream that evening and next day
so if yours doesn't get asked you can
copy and paste it there
after the show and i'll try to get to it
i was mentioning a moment ago that our
moderators are often editors too
but many are not and many of our
moderators on our other social media
forums wear multiple hats for the show
as their time and interest permit
there's around 100 volunteers who help
out on the show some little some a lot
and in a bunch of different capacities
many of which aren't general credible at
the end of the episodes
so i want to take a moment to thank them
for all they do past present and future
if you're interested in helping sfia out
in the future we're always looking for
volunteers
whether it's moderating editing
brainstorming graphics or so on
we're also grateful to everyone who's
donated to help keep the show going by
patreon or over at our website
isaacarthur.net and speaking of patrons
happy 30th birthday owen
but the biggest thing you can do to help
the show is just to share with others
and hit the like button on the episodes
lastly i want to give a quick shout out
to david dickinson who co-authored the
universe today
ultimate guide to viewing the cosmos
last year with my friend frasier kane
and who has a new book out the backyard
astronomers fear guide and sent me a
review copy
it's an excellent guidebook and if
you're looking to do some astronomy in
your backyard
october 1st is going to be the best
night year to look at mercury local
weather permitting
and we've got the draconid meteor
showers on october 7th
and mars at its best angle for
photography on october 13th
we also have an episode on mars coming
up in october too
if i've not mentioned it before i used
to run the observatory for my university
back when i was in grad school
and i always recommend autumn viewing as
cold air is best for viewing but it's
still warm enough
not to need five layers of clothes and a
thermos full of coffee or hot chocolate
it's a fun hobby but one of the few
areas where amateurs can still
contribute a lot to the science
and who knows you might save the world
if you spot that next asteroid heading
our way
and dickinson's fear guide is a great
companion for getting started
with all that said let's get back to the
show
and we're back well we have gotten quite
a bit of audience participation today
and i have a lot of questions for you
remaining so to start off with we have
kurt elm
isn't a black hole civilization
hilariously vulnerable to a hit
from a much smaller black hole like a
magazine hit to a battleship
uh potentially if you hit a black hole
with another black hole that's required
some very precision targeting because
you're going to have to pretty much hit
them right on
when two black holes merge what's going
to happen is they're going to grow
relative to their size so if i hit
another black or the black hole yes you
will have a certain amount of gravity
wave
pop out but if this is a very tiny black
hole hidden in it it's not gonna do much
to disrupt things
uh another question from the infallible
god king of humankind
says how do you think humankind will
react to the confirmation
of extraterrestrial life will people
disregard it because it's just microbial
or will we panic due to the presence of
the super advanced
uh i guess kind of depends on the
context the uh the user id name there
maybe think of 40k
so uh obviously uh if there's you know
40k style
we will react by dying a lot but uh
you know i think the last pro lesson on
this that 50 population already believes
that aliens are around and in contact
with us
such being the case you know the reality
is gonna be much more shocking but the
information itself
it'll be big news for a couple weeks and
it will be you know one of those game
changing things for
civilization but i don't think it's
gonna be riots in the streets or
anything like that
unless they are attacking us and
mourning us
yeah that that's positive
weekday war gaming asks can you have an
interstellar
empire without faster than light yes
but you know when we say you know solar
empire a lot of times what people mean
is a galaxy wide one which is you know
100 billion stars
they are around a thousand within a
light century of us in terms of
communication time that we could heal
for them and respond back in a century
that's kind of pushing it to have a
civilization going that's that big
but it kind of depends on how closely
they have to be linked together
if you've gotten yourself very stable as
civilizations
where you really just have a kind of a
loose agreement of trade treaties and
things like that that run between
the various star systems that could
probably be a pretty well knit together
thing especially of life extension going
on
similarly uh cosmo explorer 101 says
could there ever be a time period where
the population increases so fast that we
burn out our resources before we can get
enough people to different places
yes it's possible um
we have this coming we had the skunk
last time with malthusian uh
concepts is you know can you grow too
fast that you you kill yourself off as a
war on collapse
i tend to think that we're smart enough
to avoid that many people disagree and
obviously those are opinions
behind in theirs but you know we talk
about how our population growth rate is
slowing down compared to last century in
quadruple and it's still rising that's
the thing
people miss on it sometimes the
population has still been increasing
it will hit 8 billion in a couple of
years
and it was 6.2 at the beginning of the
century
um and yet that population growth rate
has
slowed a lot too um but it could go
right back up again
life extension technology where suddenly
people say i wanna have a kid every
three years and i'm gonna do it for 500
years that's going to see a big rise in
population
and it's not even getting things like
digital people cloning if you can clone
people you can produce some poverty as
fast as you want uh you know typically
in the duplication of
cloning as opposed to just growing a
twin and with digital people
they might be living ridiculously fast
their subjective time might be i'm gonna
have a kid once every thousand years of
personal time
and that means they are having a new kid
every 10 seconds
you know i i think they better consult
with their wives on that with the life
extension technology just saying when
you said three
a child every three years for 500 years
that's like 166 kids
yeah that's a dupe or not money
currently the record is 69 children for
one woman that's an awful lot well there
you go but i mean again with things like
cloning
options or with digitization you don't
necessarily need to have another person
involved either
um you got a lot of grandkids that way
too grandkids okay
we'll talk about 500 grandkids anyway um
we have a question from
zoltzy you often advocate space farming
wouldn't we need to ship
up one ton of bio waste to harvest one
ton of biomass
rendering the process incredibly energy
expensive
it's a common mistake to assume that
everything that you're eating has grown
out of things that are already dead
uh almost all the mass of a plant is
coming from water and nitrogen in the
air
right um and things like hydroponics for
instance you know
they're putting the nutrients in there
but they're still getting most of their
mass from the water and the air
nitrogen and water are available besides
this planet
you bring them in from sources they have
low gravity wells and you bring up your
basic
microbes to get the thing growing and
you know having the
available biomaterial especially
depending on the species of plant can be
very important but
generally speaking it's the microbes in
that soil that matter not the actual
soil content that you could be producing
from
almost any inorganic sources moons
asteroids etc with refinement
um hinge asks if you have any opinions
on tabby's
star we did an episode about that a few
years back and and
i you know i've not seen any new
evidence on that that really changed my
mind from thinking that was probably
going to be a debris cloud that it
turned out to be
i haven't checked on the last few months
see there's many updates uh my friend
john michael godier who runs uh
well his show and event horizon he's
always been very good at keeping up on
track on that so it's frasier kane so
i'll defer to them if there's
major developments but uh and they're
certainly sure it's worth checking out
but
um i would say that i'm still in the
opinion there's no indication that it's
an artificial source of life
sir barks a lot says how long until we
get chris
i'm sorry cryostasis so we don't have to
worry about faster than light travel
we already have it uh we can freeze
people pretty good it's just
getting them back a live bit and that's
interesting from cryonics
is that you might go ahead and ship
people out before you actually got the
method walking if you had these enough
artificial intelligence the other end
that you could
send them the blueprints and details or
how to maintain the wake them up
um the thing i like to point out though
is that the technology that you need to
resurrect some from current cryo methods
uh
essentially is identical to the
technologies you need to simply extend
their life indefinitely because you do
that kind of
very fine detail cellular repair
especially the neurons
and if you can do that then it doesn't
matter if you've got one cry or not
you can just go ahead and extend their
life indefinitely
uh and if you just worry about them
being bored on the trip uh they can find
ways to amuse themselves or you could
put them into a more
um you know a hammer type of stasis
where you're basically just shutting
their
brain activity down while keeping them
alive that whole time and they wake up
when you turn it back on no need for
freezing
andrew soto thank you for your very
generous uh very generous gift here and
his question is for uploading
consciousness could we do so by
replacing every synapse in the brain
with a copy of that structure in a
synthetic brain
so that the brain signals are slowly
migrated into the new one
migrating consciousness instead of
direct cloning
thank you very much and for your
donation too um
yes i but the difference that you just
say on that is
you know the brain is not a single
object that you necessarily need to be
replicating you could be running it
quite a ways apart from the synthetic
chunk or other bits of it but you could
also just be replacing it building by
building like a city
think of the brain like a city and you
replace the individual buildings
while the synapses starts failing down
you have the machines go in and repair
those replace those
and you might do that strictly
biologically too because you got the
technology of making copies of them in
an artificial sense like with wires or
optical fibers
then you presumably also have the
ability to just go ahead and regrow a
neuron of that right shape too i think
you just slowly replace them when you're
one neuron at a time inside that
person's brain unless they simply did
not want to be in a fleshly body anymore
so basically the equivalent of a
prosthetic brain you're slowly replacing
neurons as needed
um either with uh cloned replicated
or grown or strictly artificial ones
the interesting thing though is that
since your neurons are only
communicating
at fastest and the ones the best model
in the sheath it's basically a speed of
sound
and we can send signals at the speed of
light which is 10 million times faster
um you know you could expand a human
brain to the size
of this planet almost exactly the same
size as planned just have the noise
distribute the same places
and run at the exact same speed if it
was on you know an optical
light or as fast as light speed uh
transmission
so you could start moving their brain to
another location
uh neuron by neuron without actually
having your signal lag too
but yeah as a method for extension i
suspect the most popular one
for brain digitization or uploading or
just extension would be to
replace one neuron at a time in the
existing brain
james holden's question is what are the
key next step technologies for resource
utilization
on the moon uh that is the episode for
next week so i want to be careful talk
about too much
uh spoilers um the biggest one
is the ability to refine
metals uh and oxygen right off the
surface of the moon and
you know presumably in as automated
fashion as you can
the other one on top of that is the
ability to
use the local vagalith in a fashion that
we can make buildings out of relatively
easily and automated
and the other caviar on that is making
sure that you can do it in a way that
doesn't keep up too much that little
dust because
in many ways and we'll talk about this
uh on thursday
in many ways the hardest part of
colonizing the moon is actually dealing
with that lunar dust gets kicked up when
we do stuff there
uh it's insidious it's a pain and it's
potentially a major health hazard
and uh those would be the the key ones
for isle you is how to deal with that
regolith and make something useful out
of it like oxygen building materials and
metal
thank you for that and james be sure to
tune in on thursday
the next question is from nicole mcinnis
what is your favorite robot from
literature or cinema
and why i wonder oliver um
with a with a close runner-up probably
being uh
hal from 2001 or many of the mines from
e
m banks cultural series uh i would need
all about geological robot daniel oliver
from the elijah bailey novels caves of
steel naked son
um a couple others buyers of gazmoth
uh is probably my personal favorite for
robots he's a
detective who helps out the other
detective elijah bailey solved crimes
though rather interesting
and something people tend to forget
about asthma was how what a good mortal
mystery writer he was too
so definitely him and if you have never
read those books do so
they're great the three
internal asks what's the single most
important thing missing or the
technology to develop to kick-start the
space industry
there's a couple of them uh launch cost
being cheaper is obviously the most
most obvious one but the one i've been
favoring mostly for kick-starting
space industry in recent years is power
satellites
if you can get the ability to
mass-produce
solar power and rack tunnels down earth
and beam energy back home
now you've accessed a trillion dollar
market it's a multi-trillion dollar
market
in our global economy if you can be
sending power down from space
uh which after all costs involved is
just you know one
penny cheaper per kilowatt hour than
what we get now that's your space boom
right there
other ones would be obviously you know
you can start bringing gold home from
asteroids um you know the fuel costs
involved in
taking stuff off the moon if we could
find gold there or an asteroid stranger
sounds is
already with the current economy more
than enough to justify all that fuel
costs in terms of the value of that
material
and then of course the other one is any
sort of medical
science research or production chains
that work better in microgravity
like crystal go semiconductor growth
things like that so which one will be
the one that
is the actual snowball is hard to say
and it's very dependent like the power
satellites for instance not such a big
deal if we suddenly got walking fusion
people got a lot more comfortable with
nuclear fission so
i think uh this question from plastic
pinocchio relates back to one we had
earlier this evening
and thank you also for your contribution
but his question is why do we assume
that a signal must repeat
to be considered artificial when us
humans are the first
not to do so the arcebo signal comes to
mind
um because we move that one around right
we are repeating it but we move it
around
um because we're trying to give me as
possible the thing to keep in mind is
that we have not made a dedicated effort
as a space fan civilization to make
contact with anyone we're kind of just
kind of
popular signals around as we go and a
lot of us aren't really very fond of
that i don't think it's a good idea to
be transmitting those messages for
instance
um i just don't think it's much of a
concern because i don't expect to find
the
um it just depends what your goal is if
you know there's a civilization there
as opposed to just kind of reaching
around at random then you're going to
repeat that message that's the most
logical approach to do it just keep
repeating so someone hears you
but if you don't know then yeah you're
going to go for that especially if
you're power limited you're just going
to kind of broadcast around at random
and you have as many points as possible
uh the thing is there's an assumption
that if you're sending messages out
uh to other civilizations that you only
do this for centuries at a time and are
already space-faring to some degree
and so that means you're probably much
better at targeting things in the first
place
and it probably means you have much more
energy abundance in which case you build
a transmitter and you leave it locked
onto one location
or maybe you have it go to a thousand
that repeats every you know one second
blip every thousand seconds or something
like that
that's the assumption there it could be
wrong but if you
want to contact people you are going to
repeat you're going to keep waving at
them over and over again say look at me
look at me
and that we didn't do that ourselves
basically now the fact that we don't
have enough energy time
resources etc to be doing that
transmission that way at this time
we also have a contribution from david
foreman thank you for that
and the question is are there any
reasons for off-world
settling that you think are often
overlooked
thank you for your donation too and if i
skipped anyone thank you very much for
doing super chats um
the reasons for a settlement that have
been overlooked you know the big one
that always decided
is of course is you give me eggs out of
one basket uh the other being that we
just have a natural tendency to want to
get out there and
explore um
the one that comes to mind is most often
overlooked is also the one that's also
potential
danger too when you set a colony up in
place somewhere it will have a different
outlook
you can see that with the colonization
things we had during the age of sale
you know and or you know we've been
colonizing this planet for many
thousands of years as people wander
around and set up on places
um they have very different outlooks on
life they are very different outlooks
and that can make them potentially an
enemy or potentially a friend
but if you're taking the societal
viewpoint that your
diversity of viewpoints of many
different world views many different
challenges they've been facing that have
influenced them is a good thing
on average then that's the other big one
that you get out of colonization by
spreading yourself out to
a billion planets a million habitats
from places like venus's floating cities
to
things you've carved in the outside of a
comet to something under an alien sun
that would be the other big benefit i
think we pretend to overlook is that
all those new challenges all those new
viewpoints is going to
help your civilization a lot hopefully
and another donation here from tom
michael
and he says do you think we could ever
have another episode
involving more insight into underwater
colonies and energy production from
under the sea
creep keep up the great work dude i'm
loving all of it
thank you very much um we did the april
planets
um oceans episode and the hybrid plant
series for those who really remember
that that was like our first year or two
of production
that was the last one we did was the
ocean plants and water awards episode
um and then the series kind of got put
on hiatus in favor of the outward bound
series
and i've always meant to revisit that
and we did to some degree with the earth
2.0 series and the sea study episode and
colonized the oceans and they answered
the question on that one
i've been increasingly tempted to go
back and revisit those because
i feel like we could do multiple
episodes on c study alone now to be fair
almost every episode we do i feel like
we do many more episodes on that topic
we always get them squeezed into 30
minutes
but um i do think that we probably will
revisit that because it's
it's just fun i don't know for those who
remember any of the uh
uh old shows like seaquest dsv or things
like that the
oceans are three-quarters of our planets
and contain many interesting things and
they also likely be things we find on
other planets a lot so yes we probably
will
visit that topic thank you mr hats for
cats
says can we boil a black hole as in
could we put enough heat energy for it
to radiate mass
and he put a little side note that says
sarah you're amazing which is making me
flush
well you are amazing the cat and hat
thing made me uh think of
and i probably shouldn't say it but uh
dr seuss for those who remember i always
love dr seuss and i always want to do
his eulogy as a
should we bury him in a box should we
bury him without socks does he smell
like green eggs and ham yes he does
am i i loved his walkway up as a kid
what was the question um
the real question was can we boil a
black hole
as in could we put enough heat energy in
for it to radiate
mass um well they don't really
if you pump a lot of heat into a black
hole it's just going to absorb it
properly now it should stay very hot and
black holes actually are pretty hot
um but um
to get them to emit mass what you'd end
up doing is
they very slowly radiate with hockey
radiation and the hockey radiation is
not always photons um
of course you want to do a very small
one do that but what you probably be
doing is
because it can also come out other
virtual particle pairs like a proton and
antiproton
those are just expected to be less
common what you do is you probably
reflect the
radiated energy away from uh from a
small black hole
reflect that energy right back in except
for when it's protons or neutrons or
antiprotons or electrons
and you siphon that off and just keep
putting the normal photons back in again
which i guess would be pumping here into
it so that method could potentially work
yeah um this one is an interesting
question from lost in thought and thank
you for your generous donation as well
he says could an artificial super
intelligent cyber bio clone
of me microwave a burrito beyond the
plank temperature
and would it be able to eat the side
burrito
no because the plank temperature uh you
know for those of you familiar with
plank units
we tend to think it was very small the
plank meter was like 10 to negative 45
meters which is
a trillionth of a trillionth of a
trillion to the size of an atom and that
planck second or time interval is
like a billionth of a billionth of a
billionth of a billionth of a second uh
however some of them are very big and
plant temperature is one of those
we believe the plant temperature is the
temperature that it would be at the core
of a plank star
which is a possible black hole or when
the big bang happened it is
very hot it is the hottest thing ever uh
and
we should not be able to get hotter than
that and what's more if you actually
migrate the burrito to that temperature
you would destroy everything within
if not the planet possibly the solar
system yeah i'm not i'd have to run the
numbers on that but it would be very so
you're saying there would be nothing
left to eat the burrito there would be
nothing left to eat the burrito
oh my well we would like to avoid that
joshua scrivener says do you think there
are any particular special uses of
neutron stars and other exotic objects
for the interstellar civilizations
we were talking about making phosphorus
earlier and i'm pretty sure you could
actually use neutron stars as a
cheap way to mass produce heavier
elements indeed that's where a lot of
heavy elements come from we think
supernova
but they actually come from neutron
stars colliding
or white dwarfs colliding and you
wouldn't necessarily have to do that
specific process of an actual collision
uh
in favor of just siphoning the matter
off to something like a particle
collider and doing that at a smaller
scale
so it might be a very easy way to
produce rare elements like phosphorus
for instance or gold or silver etc
so uh here's a question from sebastian
mcconnell
if gravitons exist is it possible that
we could one day use them for artificial
gravity
possibly yeah if you can i mean gravity
kind of falls into three
types you've got the gravity that pulls
objects together we call
active gravitational force you've got
the gravity that and this is what we'd
say actually i should say mass comes in
three times you got the passive effect
of how much mass pulls things and how
much it responds to being pulled
and then how much it responds by being
pushed on by another force
and those are your three types of mass
to which are gravity
if you can find any way to actually
replicate that without using mass
you know say we might emit a signal then
you have options
and i think we discussed this in the
anti-gravity episode the clock tech
anti-gravity episode
um then you certainly have options for
producing
non-omni-directional gravity and you
know without necessarily having a ton of
mass so you might get your artificial
platinum stuff like that
um and that would be one of those really
game-changing technologies
because then you could probably start
getting with making things like black
holes that don't actually have a ton of
tidal force involved i'm going to wrap
up with just a couple more questions
here we have a donation from cozy high
again and
this is a follow-up question to an
earlier question and they want to know
how could future 3d printers be used or
misused
it depends on how good they are you know
what i was saying we brought this up in
the santa claus machine episode don't
expect it to be a star trek replicator
uh don't ever expect anything that fast
um
or that intricate but if you had
something that was pointed off the
obvious answer is you used to make all
the components you need to make a
doomsday weapon
and you could potentially be doing that
in the basement 3d printers
i think for the near future at least
i'll likely be limited to
slow intricate production or
if you just wanted to make a something
that was
not available for purchase but you're
the schematic for but it's most likely
to be used
dangerously i would say if we can get
small enough with it for the printing of
dna
and specifically any type of dna that
you want and can assemble on a computer
model
in which case you can print the dna for
ebola or the rna i should say and the
rna will be a lot easier to print
because it's so much shorter
you could print the dna for ebola that
you'd model to be even more dangerous
you could put it to be something that
was the most infectious fatal disease
you could ever have because of course in
nature they generally tend not to link
up that way the more infectious is the
less lethal tends to be that kind of
thing
you could set it so that it was a thing
that had a built-in timer where only
after it replicated 500 times
and not been exposed to oxygen the
indicator was inside the same host
organism
would it certainly turn on its lethal
mode so that would be the most dangerous
neotome option i think for um
for printing printers dna printers rna
products i guess
so uh we have a question here
uh from up and av how the how would the
dyson swarm be protected from solar
flares
it kinda depends on which type of dice
and sword will do and if you're doing
solo collectors
those are by the way nature are supposed
to be thin cheap
thin and cheap in which case you might
not bother to you know protect them you
might simply you know suck them back in
and replace them
if you're doing something that is
essentially one you know micron thick
sheet of aluminum
700 kilometers across that bounces light
to a expensive and valuable
actual power collector you might just
have it set that when the solar flare is
detected
they just fold in like a like you know
the inner voice of a flower
and protect it while they get vaporized
themselves
but for the most part solar flares are
not nearly as dangerous as we tend to
think of them sometimes from you know
from fiction
it's very easy to harden a structural
and a thing to remember
when we talk about things like cylinder
habitats as opposed to just big solar
collectors a place where people live
on earth we live over the ground the
ground is very protective
inside an el nino cylinder you live
under the ground
space and it's dangerous things are you
know outside of the dirt and the metal
from you
you look at the sky you can see the sky
inside a cylinder habitat you've got
meters of dirt steel and structure
around you
so you can build all of those as faraday
cages and by default you should go on
your cylinder for instance is a fair day
cage
you're quite protected against emp that
way and
so it's mostly about holding what you
need to hold and and to the degree that
you need to hardly be economical
and how much is economical is one of
those things we'll figure out by doing
it in stages
you know we'd want to do it as cheap as
possible for minimum replacement and
danger
i'm going to wrap up with just three
more questions here um we have one from
dincho steinov
have you watched babylon 5 and if yes
what do you think about the portrayal of
alien
cultures i love your content thank you
and i love babylon 5.
um the same thing about watching babylon
5 is the force one really take advantage
of cgi
which means that you don't really want
to watch it at
hd resolution anymore because it tends
to show through but it's it's a great
show i
typically rated this tie with me with
like star trek natural deep space nine
is like the best shows the 1990s
um the aliens portrayed in there were
often a little bit
classically cliche sci-fi ones where
they had a personality trait that was
universal for the species uh to the
point where it was more like a cultural
than what you expect from the entire
civilization but
oh and then i thought the portrayal that
was great especially the uh
you know with the the willingness to
actually have aliens that were not
humanoid in nature
uh and i'd say it's cut from
most versions of the gathering the
original tv pilot movie
because it came off looking like a jim
henson puppet show but they showed all
sorts of
very atypical and non-humanoid aliens in
that
uh but great show if you're not seeing
it go watch it
just uh keep in mind the graphics are a
little dated now
lucas harvey says i'm worried about
engineering mars
wouldn't any atmosphere we make just get
ripped apart by the sun
nope uh you wouldn't make it unless i
mean given time it will
the first thing to understand is the
atmospheric leakage is something that
so long as the speed of the gas from
temperature
is you know well under the actual escape
velocity of the planet and the escape
velocity of mars is about 10 times
higher than what we expect the
atmospheric
motion to be for those particles that is
going to result in a very
slow evaporation rate of loss and every
atmosphere leaks
what caused most that leakage is um
going to be a lack of magnetosphere
and people always talk about wanting to
put a big you know restart the core and
moles you have to do that
you just build a big metal ring around
the planet with some solar panels and
that's electromagnetic you know
artificial one it's very relatively easy
to make
and it has a high power drop but it's
nothing like what you did you know
involving the
no more level of power plant would need
anybody so it's
not trivial but it's not even the top 10
list of hard things to do to
tear a foam planet great so the last
question for today is from jay mcdonald
and it kind of looks into your future
episodes he says any chance of doing a
dedicated starship episode
seen as it has the potential to provide
the initial capabilities to launch the
beginnings of the industries and
construction projects that this channel
discusses for the potential future
um sorry what was that last piece again
um
well the last part is that a starship
a dedicated starship episode would have
the potential to provide initial
capabilities to launch the beginning of
the industry and construction projects
that you've
discussed in the past and and jay is
wondering if there's any chance that
you're planning to do a dedicated
starship episode we did the spaceship
propulsion compendium years back was
actually the first poll for an episode
of iran
on um on patreon that case and drew
mctige is one of our moderators these
days he helped me
write that episode was his idea and it
was a great episode i love doing it
um it's one of those ones where i was
about expanding into a series too but
so after we talked about spaceship
design only in the context of a specific
you know uh episode like how to get to
another solar system or how would you
build a colony ship
but yeah i think we could probably do
that but i don't think a read episode
would probably be more like a series so
for the moment i'm not starting any more
series until we finished out at least
the six four
four six episodes of becoming you know
planetary species but uh
i think yes there's a very good chance
we would do that and i think it'd
probably be a lot of fun
well i'm afraid that we're wrapping up
on time it's already after five o'clock
and so thank you to all of those who've
donated and sent their questions in
and to the mods for helping moderate
and thank you everybody for super chats
and uh we will see you all on thursday
have a great week
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook
reddit discord or our website
isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
