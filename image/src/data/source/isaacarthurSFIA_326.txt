okay
can anyone hear me now be a 20 second
wait time while we do that
technological delays
we're waiting for the audio to come in
in just a moment
and if anybody can just go ahead and hit
when they say can you hear me now
five by five can you hear me now i've
seen a lot of people saying no sound
no sound yep everyone hear me now okay
oh my yeses whoa
for those of you who can read lips
we'll go through that introduction one
more time someone says they like the
telepathy maybe you should try that a
little more frequently
just go ahead and read me through the
power of my mind all right so
um welcome to monthly
live stream q a our 31st here on may
30th
2021 uh now in full
sound audio dolby audio um and the first
in our new house
this is the first one in our new home
and as you might expect we have some
technical glitches
as usual we'll be joined by my wife the
lovely sarah fellow author
who will be asking questions as we go
please get your questions in the chat
window for the moderators
try to keep them as concise legible and
polite as possible
so they can relay those onto me as we go
so
i take it everyone can in fact hear me
and we'll go ahead and get started with
that first question
i just want to comment you have a
comment from trevor nielsen
isaac has been replaced by ai with no
sound
[Laughter]
oh my well we had a question from last
month from superposition
that we hadn't been able to get to it
said do you think that solar power in
space will supply most of humanity's
energy demands
and if so when and where um
you know in the long term it all depends
on whether or not we get something like
fusion
if we do get fusion then we have the
basically endless bounty of supply the
beginning for something like deuterium
or hydrogen vanilla hydrogen fusion
but even then um solo still can
potentially be kind of nice because
when you're generating power usually
these half of it's going to turn into
waste heat
and the nice thing about civilizations
that have access to an effective infant
power supply on a planet
is that um you can
support as many people on the planet as
you want until you have that heat
bottleneck
and since fusion would be generated
about half its power as heat
on planets a power satellite beaming
things down by microwave to be converted
back in
would be doing only about 10 to 20
percent of that as heat so you might
switch over to using power beaming at
that point too
um but power satellites i think is
probably the best way for us to be going
without fusion in the meantime and we
have no way of knowing if we'll get
fusion when we'll get fusion
and how economical it's going to be as a
reactor we shouldn't just assume would
be really really cheap to do just
because it's much more energy abundant
so i do think that power satellites are
the way to go
we had another compliment from albert
jackson he says i want to thank isaac
for hosting these the past two years
it's really meant a lot to me
thank you and he has a question as well
good afternoon isaac and sarah plastic
became popular in the second half of the
1900s
and now graphing is talked about as the
next big thing for material science
what might be next for the field there
are some other allotropes
the besides graphene of of carbon as
well some other materials that have some
super material properties meta materials
for instance
graphene seems to be the kind of the one
valve that i sometimes wonder if it's
gonna be the one that actually does a
lot of the high-tech things we think
about just because
while it seems to be so good so many
things we'll have a chance we'll
discover other
special materials that might do one
specific job better and if it does one
job just a little bit better then that's
what you use for pretty much every job
but graphene is well we did episode
impact of graphene
earlier this year maybe or last year
probably
and uh evan i'm going to mispronounce
his name evan schultz
uh one of our regular editors on the
show uh he's actually a researcher on
graphene so
uh he has showed me an awful lot of good
knowledge in terms of what's going to be
happy with that in the near future and
it does look like that's going to be one
of those fields where you know we're
going to start using graphing for all
sorts of stuff
this decade not a decade from now and
they were wondering what you think might
replace graphene in the future
no idea i would get a nobel prize if i
could come up with it i'm sure
epic monkeys and apes says hey isaac how
do you think a digital economy might
work
i mean speaking of nobel prize winner i
suppose if you actually found something
that was better than graphing you could
also have the option becoming a
trillionaire also which would be better
the
you know trillion bucks for the nobel
prize i hate saved i'd probably go with
a trillion bucks
entirely digital economy um
would be my assumption because we
already have a pretty digital economy
you would see that probably popping up
or close to it with
interplanetary and then probably uh
interstellar civilizations because
that's
the only way they can really send
information in a no ftl sense
we did talk about doing interstellar
trade at uh
at sublight speed but you still expect
the vast majority of what's getting
shipped back and forth between most
systems to be
raw information data entertainment
whatever it is um
virtual awards is another example though
because let's say you have
five thousand different virtual walls be
it uh you know middle earth or
um i can't remember any other planet
that uh warcraft set on
or starcraft or either that universe um
but you have a bunch of different you
know
virtual awards people might live in um
they can still trade regular commodities
back and forth they just happen to be
digital you know they might ship oil to
and farm in those
um so i think that in the whole we we
already have
essentially an information based economy
you always have in in reality
uh that's kind of the concept of fiat
currency in the first place and
generally what happens with the
commodity currency to be honest too
so i don't know they'll really be that
much different but just you know on time
compared to old school it might take
months to send letters of note back and
forth flank more asks on the fiction
science
science fiction side of things could
there be topics regarding
humanity even harness the world of
quantum mechanics and what it could
entail
i'm sorry say that one more time on the
side of science fiction things could
there be
topics regarding humanity uh if they
even harness the world of can
quantum mechanics and what it could
entail
i mean i'm sure it's been done i was
just thinking it's one of the books i
was putting back up on the show today
this fantastic voyage by
asthma of uh which is kind of the
original let's shrink people down and go
explore the human body one
although most you probably know the rick
and morty episode where they did that
instead
um i would not expect there to really be
a shrunken down scale that was the
equivalent with
with uh with the real world i don't
really think of the universe as being
one of those matriarchal awards where
it's like
a box within a box in the box each level
is parallel you know the uh
planetary orbital models of of atoms are
over you know there's there's no
parallels there a different emergent
property supply
but as to what a quantum scale kind of
civilization might look like uh if you
even have such thing i'd say probably
very chaotic and random
upon the pun um i mean in a way we kind
of all that emergent property because
all the rules of the normal physical
chemistries and biologies are all built
on the back of those
statistical probabilities of quantum so
this is kind of the quantum world
we'd like to thank dan o'connell for his
super chat
and he asks isaac do you see sstos
ever becoming a prac practical for leo
transport
um
right now so much the focus is on uh
reusable rockets that it's easy to kind
of
focus in on just that option and
obviously i'm pretty nervous
you know everyone thinks of me orbital
rings i love older rings i still love
them um i still think that's the way
we'll eventually go
once we have a million people living in
orbit or you know
so much industry in place that becomes
very easy to do i would say yes though i
think there is definitely a vote there
for stos
um but uh we are gonna have to see
because
again if you'd asked me about reusable
rockets even 15 years ago
i said that was so the past and it was a
stupid idea to pursue so
um you know it's one of the examples of
cases where i've just been
dead wrong so we will see
speaking of rockets i heard that if you
have a spare two or
two and a half million dollars lying
around you can go with elon musk in
outer space in a few months
i'm trying to move the actual price tag
was because i know i said somebody it
was like a quarter of a million with
jeff bezos and the blue origins but i
had that all right
the news article i saw said 2.5 million
well that might be by too although
maybe they're upping the ante on what
they're going to offer it's a good
question what the price point is or was
a virgin galactic that was the ones who
were thinking about having they don't
offer yet was thinking they could do a
price tag of a quarter million
um but yeah i mean hey we used to cost
fifty thousand dollars a kilogram for
the space shuttle program
at 41 cents being a hate mail that's the
complete cost
as broken down adjusted for inflation uh
with some people who
like the space shuttle program or really
doesn't like to have very different
prices for poor launch orbits to leo
which they get very enthusiastic about
we have gotten much cheaper to orbital
flight now
um what is your favorite isaac arthur
video this is asked by another super
chat drew mctigue thank you drew for
your
donation uh well since it's true asking
uh
the spaceship proportion compendium
uh drew uh actually was the first time i
ever did a poll question
i tend to do probably about one poll
based episode a month but it was the
first time i
did one i was on patreon at the time and
i asked everyone for ideas the one that
got voted i think was the one that got
voted up or maybe i randomly sled to
that we get to pick the title and that
was
the spaceship proportion compendium and
drew helped edit and write that one so
uh and that has actually i think that
was like one of our top 10 videos for
the show too so it's
one of my favorites um surprisingly not
civilizations at the end of time
um or that was kind of a culmination
video for me so i think it was like a
six part of
all these season two stuff uh um
probably actually that's actually pretty
good one yeah spaceship proportion
compendium
nikoi green says how soon do you think
we can create human level
artificial intelligence
um
there's always the problem that what we
define as artificial intelligence and i
had the uh well in some time in the next
month in july i'm giving a talk to
mit lincoln labs about human ai teaming
and
uh kind of what artificial intelligence
will be looking like and i'll probably
turn that into an episode afterwards but
i got to talk to one of the
folks who worked there who's an expert
on on ai
and um we have this problem of almost
every time we try to define what
artificial intelligence is
and what human level intelligence is um
we see a very narrow window of ai that
doesn't really probably qualify the vast
spectrum of what we want to use ai for
would not be human level intelligence in
fact that's probably the least
interesting level of artificial
intelligence out there
um and i've completely got what the
question was
the question was
how when do we get human for ai um
probably this century
but probably not quite as soon as uh as
as other folks who tend to be pro
technological singularity expect and it
would probably be an uploaded human mind
that we use as the baseline template so
you know a copy of a human mind is kind
of debatable as to whether you think
that as an artificial intelligence is a
mind upload and artificial intelligence
and i'm sure most of you who are
regulars already know my opinions on
artificial intelligence not being a very
good word for us to use anymore
so um you know an uploaded human mind is
is artificial intelligence well
artificial intelligence kind of
describes humans pretty accurately too
because about the most artificial thing
in the whole planet so
um it's something i do expect this
century though
so james armstrong iv wants to know
if you would be willing to clone or
upload your cat at the end of their
natural lifespan
you know flax is sitting right there i
know you keep
drifting off and looking at him and he
keeps on batting his paw around
uh he's sitting in the middle of this
new studio on the carpet like he owns
the place
which for tax purposes he does
[Laughter]
um let's see i don't think it actually
cloned on my cats
um you know again they even with a cat
there is not that much that's really
instinctual in terms of their
behavior a lot between early lord and so
it might be you know be one of the
things where they
sowed more as a constant mind or i know
a lot of folks who do do that sort of
thing
in terms of i mean i don't know many
folks do that personally but your cat
clones you get a dog cloned
and you can get a horse cloned uh
probably other things too but there's an
actual
real marker for that stuff today and i
think the horse cloning has to do with
thoroughbreds and um i don't know i
don't get
the horse ward very well my
sister-in-law is a horse person so
um i myself am not emerging she trains
horses
hannah trains horses not a centaur
nickim says i heard they already have
700 people who put up down a deposit and
they think 250
000 is the high end that are trying to
get the number lower
uh space launches
there will be a big market for i mean
you think about it we've spent
less than a thousand people to space uh
period i mean just ever less than a
thousand
um can you find a thousand people who
want to cough up a million bucks to go
to space
probably uh i mean think about it for
them it's you know will you donate this
money to charity kind of too because
you're saying this is going to help out
this company that's making this cheaper
forever notes down the road
so that's how you rationalize if you
need to rationalize spending a million
bucks to a space
um as to whether or not you do it how
many millionaires are there on this
planet it's like three percent of the
u.s population alone
um how many people make a couple million
dollars a year
probably probably around a million on
the planet so it's a lot of folks who
could potentially fork up the cash for
that
and a thousand a year it should be
doable um
hopefully that's your summer vacation
well yeah you'd probably be lucky you've
got to spend a week though
so um dag 12
says if you take two molecules and place
them a light year apart away from all
other masses
how do they detect each other
uh i guess the question be do they
recognize each other gravitically
um this is where we're getting the
wonderful concept of virtual particles
uh which are
debatably real things that's the name
virtual um
i want you to imagine for the moment
that they are a
gajillion little particles photons in
this case or gravitons photons for
electromagnetic force
gravitons for gravity that kind of ooze
out constantly from an object
and uh those that actually latch onto
something nearby
and those become real and all the other
ones
cease becoming real and they get weaker
and weaker the further they get away
from that object
and thus when they become real they are
because they're more stretched out they
exhort less force
this is one way to look at how forces
communicate with
uh with each other across between
objects in space and time
um this of course is not really correct
but
at the same time uh probably the sanest
and simplest version i can think of how
to explain how we actually move forces
between objects
but virtual particles and in the case of
where they actually
exhort something else something that's
where something real is happening
otherwise they fade off into nothingness
and there's always a vast sea of
uh virtual particles coming in and out
of existence
chris petite has earth ever been
affected by time distortions
say from a passing black hole or other
time altering condition
probably i mean we already have some as
is
um time runs slower at certain poster
plan and measurably so
you need very precise atomic clocks to
measure it and don't think you can use
this like extend out your weekend or
your life span but
if you're an atomic clock and up its
twin and you set them to each other
on a shelf and you move one to the shelf
above and one to shelf below
you'll be able to see the time run
faster on the one that is higher up
if you put one on mars it will run it's
actually slower
if you're wondering exactly how to
calculate that very approximately
very approximately if you figure out
what the thing's escape speed is
if you would take it you know at a given
level distance from planet if you know
what the escape speed was to get free of
that object that star
that solar system or galaxy and you
convert that escape velocity into the
old lens formula for figuring out what
your special relativity motion speed was
that would about give you your time
dilation
um and uh loosely it doesn't include
things like rotation very well
and um that is how time distortion works
has something big pacifies like a black
hole
not too close um and you gotta keep in
mind for a star
uh like a black hole if it was the same
mass of sun originally it had the same
gravities all sun is this black hole
coming by um
it's not going to distort sp you know
space-time um
anymore passing by the distance the sun
is from us than the sun does
so it had to have passed very close
indeed right um
and we probably would have had the plan
b
an error message on your camera is there
an error message
i appear to be i think it's lost you
again we seem to be having issues with
that
camera since moving welcome to this new
studio let's see what happened to you i
don't think it likes this new place
oh it was back there we go
did i disappear like you think i
disappeared all right well let's assume
that i
no longer disappeared the vanishing and
reappearing wonderful i've never this is
it's a canon eos camera
um i have a power supply at that
pleasantly outside
uh virtual one and uh it looks like it
just start on me again
it says eos webcam utility beta wow
i'm not sure what's up with that all
right we're going to go to break
so we'll be on break for a few minutes
and it's a great time to get some
questions into our moderators or grab a
drink and a snack
while we're on break though i mentioned
the elevator conundrum in our recent
episode arcology design
the problem of how taller buildings need
more and more floor space on each level
devoted to elevator shafts
and that there are more parallels for
horizontal motion like roads rails and
pipes
but i also mentioned a bottleneck on
shipping on and off planet
and i thought it'd explain that while
we're on break now we could get such a
bottleneck on obvious elevator parallel
like a supertall space tower or a space
elevator
but in this case i meant in terms of the
heat energy released by launch
and takeoff way back in our episode
evacuating earth i talked about how a
kardashev 2 civilization might have
billions of spaceships
in a single solar system but be unable
to evacuate a planet super quickly
simply from all the heat of their
engines as they land to pick up things
we want to evacuate like precious relics
and people
it takes about 30 million joules of
energy to get a kilogram into low orbits
and that's about how much energy
something landy and air breaking our
atmosphere will generate
though the launch will be more expensive
as you're not just breaking something's
momentum by dragon friction but spitting
out a stream of hot gas that outmasters
your payload
and needs speeding up which is done by
berniette
while fighting atmospheric friction
which produces a lot of heat
the ratio of fuel to mass varies from
fuel type
krc needing higher percentages than
liquid hydrogen oxygen for instance
though it is probably worth noting that
you also generate heat while making
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen
but even a pretty optimistic approach on
fuel to orbit in terms of heat release
is going to come in at 10 times more
heat energy being released than the
kinetic energy our object has when it
finally gets to orbit
or 300 mega joules of heat per kilogram
from going up by rockets
now that's a lot of energy but minuscule
compared to earth's energy budget which
is about 500 million times that per
second of sunlight coming in and leaving
so we might assume we can get away with
having two percent of that budget for
getting into orbit
in which case it means we can move
around 10 million kilograms into earth's
orbit every second
or around a billion tons every single
day
that's a lot but in the contest of an
echimonopolis a planet-wide city
there might be some galactic empire's
capital like coruscant or trantor or
terra
that would bottleneck them probably a
billion people coming and going each day
and we often envision these worlds as
housing trillions of people with ships
coming and going non-stop
if we're contemplating realistic
galactic empires where there might be
quadrillions of people just living in
our own asteroid belt
let alone the neighboring systems of our
galaxy then a few billion tourists a day
or a trillion a year starts mean if your
empire had a quintillion people
barely enough for a single dyson swarm a
billion billion folks
you would need a million years to let
everyone visit once without scorching
your plan to a cinder
just by letting them land and take off
with themselves in a suitcase
neither say things like space elevators
and orbital rings can help with this
but only to an order of magnitude
probably it's one more reminder just how
counterintuitive the future might be
when we seriously contemplate the scale
of those civilizations
and with all that said let's get back to
your questions and back to our show
it does look like invisible at the
moment we have transported isaac back
to the studio via dsl camera
hopefully i think it's not too quick yet
um no let's see so
for those who uh who are just joining us
after the break uh and missed our
original
muting for the first three minutes we
also still be in the deposit sitting at
the studio hence why i have
ornaments for the studio are just
sitting there there's my youtube award
here's my nice teddy bear from i can't
really the company that makes the teddy
bears there's the vermont
well mountain teddy bears there's the
big sfia logo one of the fans made me as
a woodcut pole i think was his name
and there was my nss oh there's my
inaccessible one that's my potential
i'll just show this off a second if i
can bring it over here without smashing
the place up
so i want to thank the national space
society for this wonderful award
uh and i believe we're doing assembly
for that
that was we already recorded it
virtually and that should be out a
couple of days on the national space
studies website and time for their next
conference so
a very good wardrobe won all right next
question
okay so we were uh at the one with chris
petty and we had talked about time
altering conditions so we are now to uh
bring
ben pruir can we
use active support to build structures
with a much higher tensile strength
so that we could build structures like
banks orbitals and ring worlds
um i don't really think there's going to
be any zone for doing that
we did talk about doing that in our
ringboards episode the idea is
how do we fake something that's got
strength that is just far beyond
anything that even graphene can make
and where you would do that is by making
a really big thick
non-spinning or very slowly spinning
ring potentially a counter rotating ring
and then inside of a much thinner ring
that you actually put your habitat on
so think about how enormously huge a
ringing water actually is or banks over
or 200
for a bank's orbital or more and ring
water millionaires
think about something that big that's
the tiny little inside rotating gasket
practically with a gigantic hub
that is a slow moving uh counterweight
to it basically
and on that you might have a magnetic
cushion and that's what's keeping it in
place
and to kind of get around having to use
tensile strength
uh can you do that yes would you do that
um potentially you might have a big
uh hub called the outside bit that
counterweight that was basically
tanks full of you know hydrogen helium
or dark matter or something you really
can't build civilizations out of
and which is very numerous so that is
where you might do that at
and then your actual you know size might
be
a ring word it might be a bank's overall
both those occupy kind of a sweet spot
of of radius
or you might do something in between
that had to do with your actual ratio of
useless matter only g hydrogen helium
and dark matter to
use for construction matter eg carbon
oxygen ion etc
jack maher says which will come first in
human history a moon base or a mars base
we have an episode titled moon base
versus smallest base
what was it maybe it was moving the
episode for the full
episode yeah i guess it'd be a month and
a half so that comes out
two months sometime in august i think
will july
haran ibru asks me a question he says
living with isaac for so long have i
learned a lot
absolutely i'm transported to new worlds
every day
uh funeral hi isaac how large would
interstellar spaceships have to be
potentially um a lot of folks think you
could make them basically the size of a
pin
we've talked about that as the small end
of things uh
and get back down a second others would
say that you have to do it the size of a
planet and those your two kind of far
away big sizes
do you have to transport a planet or
solar system to really move between star
systems as a
stable ecology or could you use
something so small that was basically
just a micro sized
hard drive with nothing but uh you know
atomic level storage but
copies of mines and official
intelligence on it um
and um
you know somewhere in between there we'd
say an o'neill cylinder was probably
to my opinion the on the big side of
what you would actually need to send
to have a reasonably complete ecology
especially if frozen
uh steer episode exporting earth in the
uh generationship series for that
on the small end uh
you know we talked about a neo-sized
spaceship that was really popular with a
lot of technological singularity or
stuff in the late 90s early 2000s
you know here's this tiny little you
know artificial intelligence on a robot
it's got a couple of universal
assemblers on it
and it got trashed while i was traveling
between solar systems because
interstellar dust and radiation is um is
you know
very very non-discriminating what likes
to wreck
and if your system is that small you
have no radiation shielding you know
that's all about distance
radiation shielding is all about the
idea that a very sensitive object can be
surrounded a lot of stuff that's
basically
unsensitive being smashed around and you
need that layer and i would generally
say your smaller size than it's probably
in the area of a meter
but then you keep in mind about stuff
like universal assemblers if i got
tiny little machines to go build more
themselves
so they only need to launch something
the size of a needle or a finger or a
meter across and they can go to another
solar system build a whole new
civilization off of that
i'd also use those exact same machines
to take apart a few million
you know mega tons of random asteroids
that we don't need here
that we have tons of just take apart one
out of a you know
a million of those and send out whole
all models of ships instead to the
nearby neighboring solar systems
so you know you don't send out a von
neumann pro to other solar systems
you send it out in your own solar system
first and
that means you get away with very big
ships isaac bradeau
welcome back he says i know you do not
think alien civilizations are very
common
if you could give a rough estimate how
far away do you think is the closest
alien civilization
um i mean i'm kind of
on the fence about it anyway my general
philosophy being
based on what i can see i think it's
more likely than not that there's not
any
advanced civilizations out there within
a billion light years for us i'd say
there's 50 50 odds of that anything
beyond that you really can't talk to
um but i wouldn't be surprised if we
didn't have any even inside our own
helper value
um and there's assumptions there there
are those big things of
is there a perpetual energy motion
machine can you travel faster than light
do we live in a simulation oh those
completely throw that whole question on
the edge see the fully paradox series
for the details but the dyson levity is
the big one on that
that says why you can't be having these
civilizations
anywhere nearby because there's just no
sign of them
camera air um while we're messing with
the camera
i hope my audio is still going on with
that it is
that is really irritating would you like
this camera
no let's go with this one for the moment
okay we've got to see about 10 minutes
dt phenom says which industries do you
expect growing the most in the next
three decades are there any companies
that you are interested in
were space industries or was it just
industry it just didn't specify
which industries um
i always feel inclined to say
cryptocurrency because somebody ever
everybody really loves it or really
hates it um
uh and the cameras went again didn't it
yeah let's bring that one over here and
we'll switch over to that
keep going with that anyway while while
she was bringing the camera over i hope
i can still hear me
um we uh
in terms of industries that we're
getting bigger i think the computers
about maxed out in terms of hard drives
hardware or even silver stuff like that
it's probably going away
and um sometimes i hate technology
let's go ahead and switch that over
okay so we have a camera on there now
and
uh yeah there we go hi hello we're going
to transport you to outer space
okay technical issues again for anyone
who's just tuning in
we've recently relocated uh our uh our
metropolitan packing this afternoon yeah
they're actually all a bunch of boxes
here so we got the camera
studio
and it's back okay that's just weird
would try to keep that there-ish and
you're doing another twist and spin this
is what they do in outer space when
they're
uh on the space shuttles you know you
view the camera through
rotating lens and it allows you to see
many different angles that's true so we
have to do a nice camera rotation there
big industries for the next was it
decade or 30 years
just ones that you're interested in oh
okay um
hmm apple amazon
microsoft google facebook
um no i think that the big new industry
is probably going to be in meta
materials in terms of something that's a
completely new
sector probably materials and hopefully
uh more space-based research for now but
i think
space-based research and maybe tourism
have a real chance to blossom the next
couple decades
tommy vasquez says the first casualty in
outer space
in this new era when and how do you
think it will happen and what will be
the most likely repercussions for space
programs at that time
unfortunately with the last casualties
the repercussion on space programs was
nobody can go um you know when
when any of these things blow up what we
do is kind of ground the whole fleet
uh and some people say that's being
overly cautious but um
you can't look at this from a
governmental angle someone says we want
to send people to the moon or mars and
so
okay what does this actually accomplish
and one of the big selling points the
end is not going to really be scientific
research if you're just saying people
there for a couple weeks because a robot
really could do that better
in terms of actually picking up your
samples a big factor that is going to be
prestige
and uh you know the ability to done it
first right
and a lot of nations like the idea of
being the ones who do that what you
don't want to do
is be the country that has not prestiged
but a gigantic state funeral
when you lose somebody that way um we're
going to lose more people in space
in the future the vast majority of
people die will die in space
hopefully because hopefully that'll be
where most people live
but to get there we still don't want to
be reckless
and it is always kind of that back and
forth between
um you know are we being overly cautious
or are we being overly reckless and
i suspect we will probably
at this decade we're hoping to see an
awful lot of manned vessels commercial
manned vessels from
from spacex from blue origins from um
virgin galactic going up into space and
hopefully more uh we're going to see
more from the u.s from russia from china
from
usa and for many more they are going to
be trying to send people into space this
decade it's going to be great we'll
probably send more people in this
upcoming decade
than in the entire history of space
travel combined
and if we are lucky no one would i
but uh i i would not keep my fingers
crossed on that sadly
i saw a comment earlier asking whether
or not you had to make a donation to get
your question answered
the answer is no but we uh definitely
appreciate
those donations as they help to keep the
studio
improving the camera is a case in point
but improving our technological
apparatus as well as paying for all of
this heady knowledge that you've
collected over the years
and so i want to give a shout out to
void for their
super chat he has a question
i've heard strange matter could generate
power when bombarded with neutrons
and maybe enough to be used as a ship
drive what are your thoughts
um i say force that i i
i've never had a problem with that
camera we've had nothing for like a year
but i guess probably it's time to
anyway um strange battle has properties
we don't really know about yet because
we
have only ever made a little tiny bit of
it ig one or two
atoms at a time in a lab i
don't know that strange matter should
even interact with a neutron
specifically differently than what a
proton for instance
um though i'd have to actually think
about what these specific properties of
the strange quark are at the moment in
terms of charge
um we should be able to build stuff
there are six types of quarks right
up down top bottom because one creative
and strange and charm
um and uh we should be able to build
stuff out of strange charming top and
bottom corks not just
up and down ideally it would seem weird
for the universe to have
you know six types of quarks only use
two of them ever and have no use for the
other ones
uh i don't know how you'd actually be
producing
i suppose the assumption there would be
have a big amount of matter antimatter
annihilation between the strange cork
and the neutron
um but uh or at least the strange atom
but absolutely has one strange quark in
it and an up and a down
batman for instance but that's the only
thing i could think of so that's all i
can think of that would actually cause a
reaction you could drive a ship on uh we
have a question from ira zwan
and thank you for your super chat he
says hello
isaac arthur will there be another
collaboration with john
michael godier uh almost certainly at
some point
i would say john is one of those people
who i just love working with
uh so there was there was a lot of
generally decent and great people i've
had a chance to work with i was since
the show is taken off in size but
um john's probably still my favorite to
actually work with he's just
fun to talk to so is his crew too so
salmon suleman people often say that
nuclear fission power is
always 20 years away do you think that
there's actually a real possibility or
is it just a pipe dream
uh yes i was just thinking in terms of
collabs i'm working on script right now
with
what if alt history um and uh hopefully
that will be coming out
in the next month or so so that's the
collab is going on
um we have this
comment that comes up about fusion it's
gotten to be a bit of a truism when
people say that
loosely speaking what happened was we
discovered the very
basic things of atoms around the turn of
last
century we started discovering what you
know protons and electrons and neutrons
were in that
you know alpha particles which are
helium atoms without ions you know
electrons in them beta particles
electrons and positrons
gamma rays and all that stuff was in the
30s in the 40s
you know we got a reactor very basic
atomic power walking and we got the bomb
and then a few years later we got the
fusion bomb
so everyone looking at that said well
we're probably one generation away
that's the loose number you give for new
technology
we're generation away from probably
having fusion reactors you can see how
quickly went from
knowing what an atom was to having an
atomic reactor to an atomic bomb to your
fusion bomb
hey a fusion reactor is probably just a
generation or 20 years away
that's it and then some folks have
occasionally said that a little bit more
optimistically in like the 70s
look like we might have some moosh in
that direction but no one's been going
around saying it was going to be 20
years for sure we didn't know
um it makes sense it was one generation
away is it possible yes but
you know from my part i think it's time
for us to move past that use of that you
know it's the fusion
technology 20 years from now and always
will be i don't think it's helpful
um and i hate to admit that i start with
guardians one of those statements like
iceland is green and greenland is icy or
in you know
in europe they call soccer football it's
like ah
okay that doesn't help everybody knows
that
we'll get fusion we will get it how
economically viable it will be
you know we keep making new improvements
towards every day
when will become economically viable
hopefully sooner than later but we don't
know yet when it might be
20 years might be a century it might be
a decade it's slow though because
with fusion research we typically have
to build the entire installation
uh run the experiments then get
analyze analysis of the that and then
get funny for another
generation of experiments build that
whole thing up and do it again
so every little thing we need to learn
has this big time gap a requirement
of just lots of new stuff we're
eventually going to hit close enough
that we ought to pin it down
but that might not be the next
generation of fusion reactors or it
might be
we'll have to say if you want to go
faster encourage your government to
spend more money on fusion research run
multiple projects at a time
and uh i mean i'd say it bootstrap it by
saying
spend twice as much on production to get
done in a quarter of the time or
something like that
that's the best advice i could give on
that i don't know if that's wise though
jacob says what is your preferred fuel
for chemical rockets in the near term
he likes lo2 or lh2
as it can be stored as water which has
more uses than just fuel
and is less explodey than hydrocarbons
well the the problem with using liquid
hydrogen oxygen as a fuel is you
actually can't store it as water if you
want to use it as a fuel
um because you have to spend more energy
to crack it back into hydrogen oxygen
and get out of it
um everybody likes to use liquid
hydrogen hydrogen is awesome
uh it's the most energy reactive one
you've got and hopefully with the new
generation of graphene line tanks for
instance we can actually store the stuff
usefully
but it's a pain to handle right um
a lot of folks don't know they hear a
very complex thing about jet fuel rocket
fuel
rocket fuel is in most cases um propane
and kerosene
you know kerosene sorry um you can make
propane rockets too
kerosene is the big one just kerosene
usually a little bit more refined in
terms of getting impurities out of it
um that's the one that use probably use
the most
and liquid hydrogen is the one that is
most effective
in terms of best speed for minimum fuel
but it's hard to store and work with so
we want to thank all of the folks that
are subscribing it's
great to see your names popping up on
the screen thank you
to them and the next question is from
another isaac how will virtual reality
technology progress within the next few
decades
oh you know i was growing up the only
other odds guy
heard of was asthma how a virtual
reality technology progressed in the
next decade when i was a kid
uh we had like a nintendo
super nintendo's follow-up was a vr
headset what i think was a wireframe
um and it was horrible
and bulky at the same time we had tv
shows that were constantly saying oh
there are all of them with virtual
reality centers like the holodeck and
star trek
um probably the worst piece of
technology they have for the star trek
universe the holodeck
i like it yeah it's cool it's cool but
it lets you do too many they've
so many episodes they'll basically set
on the holodeck you gotta explore in
space and the holodecks what's
interesting
you do holodeck episodes back on earth
right
the grass is always greener on the other
side of the fence about why that's why
you're exploring space
not the holodeck uh voyager i think star
trek voyage was the one who overdid it
with the holodeck i thought
um but uh virtual reality how's virtual
reality progressing in the next uh
couple of decades so we have a lot of
books
in the 80s you don't want a virtual
reality to become a holodeck
you guys are going to have to excuse me
again new studio just move still
unpacking
camo burnt out or whatever it did
and we had to move to the last minute so
um
let's see virtual reality gets to be
more commonly in use
there's a oculus headset right there
i don't use too often myself because i
wear contact lenses when i use it
um and some people love them uh to me
that technology's still not entirely
there
i want something probably closer to like
a pair of glasses that are comfortable
where to really be able to do
virtual reality is it going to be out
there oh yeah it's going to be improving
heavily and expect to see a vr headset
probably get to be about as common as
pc's war
in the 90s in about the same way too um
in terms of utilization most houses will
probably have a vr headset
from one manufacturer or another whether
it's a smartphone naval one or one more
complex
than the next few years honestly for the
us
but i would say augmented reality is
probably the one that's going to really
hit
more in terms of miniaturizing things
inside glasses and so forth
marvin hall says i'm a longtime fan i
have a question that's been on my mind
for a while now
would it be possible for a form of alien
life to develop that could utilize the
cmb for photosynthesis
um no
maybe uh um one thing we talked about in
black holes the end of time
in black hole fall means civilization at
the end of time is the idea of living in
a universe where
the ambient radiation uh from the cmb or
things like that is actually what your
female civilization on
not the ambient radiation but black
holes are around that temperature
um the cmb is in the microwave range
so in theory you could actually run
something on this we you know we talk
about doing
power satellites using microwaves um
so it's in that frequency um i can't
know what exact
frequency 2.7 kelvin's at that's the
temperature of those
of the cmb right now problem is every
part of the universe is exactly that
temperature you can't do work
in bath bottle right all of our
thermodynamic principles went on the
idea that you need a hot and cold
reservoir or you need something higher
density as a water to really work off of
you can't do that there it's because
it's the same out everywhere
you could potentially make something
that was impermeable to the cmb that run
alpha but
yeah i think about the amount of power
you're talking about when you're when
you're dealing with the cmb
at the local level um it's
ridiculously tiny uh i think
yeah we found that like to make a macho
scavenge that would be able to
convert itself so it was big enough to
be actually in the background of the cmb
you know dyson spheres are invisible
because the same temperature the cmb or
in that range they'd have to be you know
i think something like a tenth of a
light year across
uh to get to the point where they were
doing a dyson spheres level of energy or
maybe it was even more that made 10
light years across
very tiny i don't think you'd run
anything useful off of that level of
power that was
naturally occurring so my back of that
shoe
says is apparent try time travel through
a wormhole instant or would there be a
delay
oh yeah depends on the type of wormhole
this is
you'll hear a lot about how wormholes
work uh when people are either doing
science fiction or discussing science or
wormholes um
uh there are several different versions
of wormholes in theory and they all
operate very differently
kind of the classic one that's the
sci-fi not the sci-fi one
the one that lucy allowed under general
relativity that people most commonly
look at
that has typically had a requirement of
several hundred stellar masses
uh to actually produce it it's a
gigantic black hole
and it takes months potentially to
travel down through a thing
but you shave you know potentially
millions of years off your voyage so
um wormholes have long throats they take
a while to transit
um stargate sg1 probably a little bit
more of a better view than we see in
other ones where it's like a
like a window or gateway that you step
through but they're all
versions of the concept that that
include those
question from chile emerald thank you
for your super chat
would you have any opinions on aliens
creating star systems out of gas
giants like brown dwarfs but we smash
them until they make a star
say that one more time would you have
any opinions on
aliens creating star systems out of
giant gases
or i'm sorry gas giants maybe i read
that incorrectly
out of gas giants like brown dwarfs but
we smash them until they make a star
you can brown wars don't really have
enough mass to be real stars
you have to get that red dwarf range
would be handy but you could smash one
down you know i think if you
if you did crush one up we talked about
doing that in someone jupiter
uh actually see the episode somewhere on
jupiter making suns for discussions in
detail
but yeah you could potentially compress
a regular brown dwarf of brown dwarf
mass to the point where it was
doing fusion um the whole concept of why
star eats a certain amount of mass
to fuse to produce light is that it
needs that much shoving down it from its
own gravity
uh you could compress something though
uh you put a shell around and just
squish
um the other alternative of course is to
dump like a white dwarf or a neutron
star into one
although i it's kind of a scale issue we
say
let's drop a white dwarf or a neutron
star into a round dwarf as can i say
let's drop this cup into a pool
uh without realizing that the pool is
actually much less massive than the cup
it's just size wise one's bigger um it's
really the neutron star that's eating
the brown dwarf something like that
start fusion back up again but that
walks
or causes supernova or both
we've got a lot of questions from
isaac's today today we have another
question from
isaac barrowa how many complete earth
clones
could we fit into our solar system
assuming we can add mass to planets
convert gas giants to stars and add red
doors to the outer solar system
okay um i think this is often discussed
like an ultimate solar system thing um
the most planets you can stuff
into a solar system um
if you want to start taking liberties
with solar system
um one second
um
doing a little mental calculation uh yes
yeah
fast math a million a billion billion
about one billion billion plants into a
very extended solar system
uh if you were doing things like putting
up a big nice central black hole that
you rotate a bunch of red dwarf
clusters around each of which had plants
lined up and uh the reason i get that
number is because that's we start
getting close to what you call the birch
planet level where you have to worry
about everything being stuck inside a
black hole simply because it's not dense
but it's so massive
um so there you go there's your point
sports planet scale
question from ming zhong just wonder if
there's a plan for colonizing
mini neptune or super earth such as the
hypothetical
ninth planet and what would the pros and
cons be i'm
just going to go ahead and say it the
ninth planet
is neptune neptune i think you said mini
knight
mini neptune if i read it sorry about
that mean enough to use the type of
planet
the ninth planet is neptune and pluto is
planet 10
most times sometimes nine pluto is a
planet
um well it's yeah
um because series would be the planet
one at that point i guess you could add
some of the other asteroids and
they used to be the original four
asteroids used to be considered planets
uh until we found other ones okay a mini
neptune
is colonizable so is ac both
they're always gonna be colonized by the
questions whether or not you'd actually
want to
um in terms of terrifying them you know
if you're a channel regular you already
know how we can pretty much colonize
anything we've talked about causing
stars directly and black holes directly
um it all depends on how artificial
you're willing to get
and what exactly you're colonizing it
with um
you know if you actually want to set up
something like a human
earth-like settlement on the place in
the real world not like a virtually a
simulated world running out nothing is a
power source
um for me neptune that actually might be
a fun thing to explore for an episode
though
i don't think we've actually done a
superwolf's episode either
namely it's doable let's let's we'll
think about maybe do an episode on that
hey isaac would you ever consider doing
a video
on both the physics and possible
technological applications of
topological defect phenomena like
magnetic monopoles and cosmic strings
cosmic strings are something i've heard
about in quite a long time
uh they are very popular in the i guess
would be the 90s too
um but late 80s um kind of a
instead of a point like black hole for
those of you aren't familiar with them
because they kind of fall out of common
discussion
uh it's a tiny little point of zero
dimensions in all directions because of
strings like a
one dimensional black hole big long line
and there was a two dimensional version
people discussed too
magnetic monopoles
i worry about when we start looking at
things and be it strength theory at
magnetic monopoles and say well our
theory in our masses this thing that we
don't observe must exist
so we have to figure out where it does
exist or why you know maybe you should
be focused on figuring out why it
doesn't or what's wrong with our theory
but um i may be interested to look at
well we almost don't discuss topology
anyway and i'm pretty rusty on it but it
might be worth doing episode magnetic
monopoles or cosmic strings yeah
couple new ideas um we never want to
have topic ideas for the show
that's right and every live stream
brings up new ones so
a question from alan zhang
what is the hardest physics and or math
class that you took in college
um officially partial differential
equations
um if you decide you want to major in
physics you will be getting a minor and
mathematics minimum
and a lot of universities you can take
pretty much one extra class and get a ba
a batch of results in math or bs but not
only not that much harder effort too
because
you need a lot of math to go into
physics if you choose not to do these
things
you go into grad school you will still
love having to take many more classes
either by auditing them or by just being
handed a book and reading them
but um i've over there got a whole big
list of
books the top shelf is the math ones but
the big lights at
if you read the titles you can figure
out which one you think is hardest out
of that group
so i think pde was the last math class i
officially took
them podunk says is it just me or is
isaac's speech impediment basically gone
or do i just listen to him a lot i did
take a speech therapy
for like three years uh i stopped doing
that probably about four months since we
got married
um screwed up gone so much that was
getting hard to schedule anything
um i would never think my speech
impediment was gone though
uh especially during the live stream you
probably don't notice as much when we're
recording because i tend to be a lot
slower or scripted
i really focus on things and do takes
and i'm not seeing anything very clearly
if you're only used to listening to
episodes and you're listening to a live
stream you're probably catching me
mumble sometimes i'll speak very quickly
um and i would imagine the speech
impediment is probably still much more
noticeable
then and for everybody who catches on
border embracing nuclear power episodes
you get to hear me probably flood the
world nuclear armor times too
i do think it's improved a lot though
thank you for
noticing the improvement thank you and
it actually was much better than i was
in my early 20s too
um all right so we got time for i think
probably one more question oh
i got several more here with them
okay rapid fire canadian says isaac how
massive does something need to be to
have its own gravity
one wow very tiny
um i would say
less than a quark though that could say
that quantum gravity issue is so is
debatable
atomic scale though rory not my last
name
says how likely are large star systems
with several habitable planets such as
the 34 atari system from firefly
and saranas from the battle star
galactica ah
so your episode colonizing giant stars
actually pretty decently likely they'd
be habitable but probably not very
likely to be around long enough to have
civilizations more around them naturally
we got asked if we were in outer space
that must have been when the camera was
flying around everyone's out of space
uh carlos says on a trip to pluto if you
could bring three tv or streaming
service shows with you what would those
shows be
star toyota stream nebula and uh
that's no fair you just picked the
curiosity stream nebula
and another one um amazon
yeah amazon's actually a sponsor the
show through audible so yes
those three um the last super chat of
the day that we're gonna give a shout
out to is from dobrev
thank you for your super chat and he
says when will we see the first murder
in space hopefully no time soon but i
would guess
uh i'll do a keen enable analogy there
probably within
a decade of at least a dozen people
living up in orbit
cinnabal says do you have an opinion on
ian
m banks the culture series and his take
on an evolved civilization
if you're a star trek fan e m banks
culture series is a very fun one to read
because it co it's it's it's a nice
follow-up the late great e
m banks um i am most fond of his ever i
was
i'd say the three novels i liked by him
four and i was willing to like the most
uh consider phlebus um uh
i love these ones i can't my name is
playoff games accession and
book three the one with the chair it was
where the book will know what it is i
just can't think of the name right now
very good author so paul rome
i get that the collision of the milky
way and andromeda
won't result in many individual stellar
collisions
but what about the central black holes
will they collide and what effects would
that have
eventually um following up on em banks
real quick
uh i would not consider his work to be
terribly realistic from a scientific
perspective
uh but it's great anyway um
we probably need to start moving away
from the idea of anger and the milky way
colliding
that maybe the force does that but the
milky way
has been eating smaller galaxies up for
a long time and we'll give the andromeda
and vice versa along with everything
else in this area we believe in the next
three to ten billion years that's gonna
be where a lot of that's going down
uh until we are just left that one big
mega galaxy
um left alone by itself as everything
else expands of the hubble horizon
um cosmological horizon um
that will have very few stellar
collisions initially but all those
remnants will eventually hit you don't
have
big black holes that don't eventually
merge they will ring down eventually
and and then collide that may take
several trillion years possibly several
what's the number after trillion
quadrillion years
but it should happen eventually last
question of the day
from big zebra why is your studio an
exercise in landlord beige
that's in quotes i was gonna say uh you
know
even big black holes in the centers of
galaxies are only about
you know orbit of pluto kind of size or
smaller
um so it's not like they're very likely
to collide
uh what colors beige
i think it's because you know the studio
is so much the same color as the last
studio that if it wasn't for the
curtains people wouldn't know we had
moved
except for the technological
difficulties oh well beige is the new
gray
that's right because the contractor will
come in here yet and put doors on
and then we can paint actually uh it's
because i just i decided that beige was
a much
better light reflecting color than gray
and we wanted it to be more cheerful
but then this one was already painted
this shade yeah this was the shade we
came in we haven't painted yet
um i'm not sure i would either um and
the other place say i did actually pick
out all the colors for the previous
studio so
uh i guess is that the question we'll
close you
did you want a different question let's
do one more
uh okay we have to edit out the first
two minutes of the video from being
quiet anyway someone said shouldn't
julian come before quadrillion
which one drillian jillian how do you
know what drilling is i think trillion
then
sextillion septillion octalian
and at that point i think that's gonna
account for some sort of higher math
course yeah
there's also the google platform i guess
what google comes from if nobody saw us
but
or the other way around some made up
number i don't know
oh my we had a super chat here from
sapphire elf
thank you and i am
just going to see we also have a super
chat from mostly folders a little bit of
everything
and he says thanks for what you do when
do you think new battery tech
is likely to be more common than today's
one eight six five zeroes oh
sorry we'll end on a stumper um
what i think battery tech's gonna get
better yeah
every day um when will get better enough
so that i can probably i'm assuming
whatever
got the camera say was the false sight
power supplies put in there in the fake
you know for the fake battery thing um
so i just went on a power plug
um graphene batteries are probably the
next one that's a real
step up or one that runs on kind of the
same basic principle
but uh i would say the lithium ion ones
are so much better than like even nickel
cadmium that we had
obviously like a decade back was still
the big battery for rechargeability
um if he remembers the old old days of
going to radio shack and
uh buying batteries and having to run
through like five or six double d
batteries just to run a stereo for a
while i can appreciate how much more
battery technology has improved the last
couple decades but it's still at the
point where it's weaker than chemical
fuels
right in terms of density and that's
going to be the one that's the real big
paradigm shifter for battery technology
against your portable power energy
episode um but
uh when you get the point that batteries
rechargeable batteries
can start carrying a power density
similar energy density similarly in
chemical fuels
uh or hopefully even better that's when
you see the complete shift over to an
electronic economy
and hopefully soon later i guess on that
note we can go ahead and close on out
