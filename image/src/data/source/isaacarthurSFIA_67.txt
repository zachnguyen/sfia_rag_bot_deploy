our discussions on the for Paradox and where 
all the aliens are tends to assume we will be  
able to colonize the Galaxy at some point but 
a lot of effort and luck is needed to build a  
Titanic Ark ship to fly across trillions 
of miles of cold and empty space to bring  
people ecosystems and Industry to a dead and 
Barren Planet the Aurora effect contemplates  
the idea that even if you are successful getting 
there many decades or centuries after you left  
many of the people many presumably on the 
trip May lack the desire to fight an uphill  
struggle to bring life to a dead planet and 
either turn the ship around or settle for a  
minimalist Colony that never truly grows much 
and may later die from even minor cataclysms  
as they are less robust against catastrophe by 
being a small civilization on a baron world we  
explored such catastrophe scenarios in our 
recent episode The FY Paradox panoo Theory
