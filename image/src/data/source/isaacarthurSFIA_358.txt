we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink and a
snack
though we'll take a break about halfway
through too with all that said
welcome and let's get started
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
our last live stream for the year
we're getting started in just a moment
as we get questions ready we have a few
people away for the holidays so kind of
going to be running things
as we can so there may be a few type of
glitches we could start up here
as usual my wife sarah will be asking us
our questions try to get him posted into
the uh
live stream chat and uh i know it's john
michael gudio is here today hey john
and um as we get started here just go
ahead and post those in the chat try to
make them as pronunciable as possible
well our first question today is coming
from chris leach
and he says hey isaac hope you had a
merry christmas wondering what your
thoughts are on the biosphere 2
experiment and the challenges of
maintaining a small
closed-loop ecosystem how can we
overcome it
well biosphere 2. that was in the i came
with it was late 80s or early 90s
for those who aren't too familiar with
it um check wikipedia for more accurate
details
but i believe it was out in the uh
either nevada or utah they built a very
large greenhouse
multiple domes things like that and the
idea there was to check and see if we
could actually do a completely separate
ecology
that was closed off and they sent six
people in i believe for that um
there were problems with data collecting
the data and some cheating on carbon
dioxide as well as snacks
and so we were never too sure if we got
the data on it right
but that was one of our first big
attempts to really see if we could do a
closed environment and i think we
probably do a little bit better these
days we did some useful ideas of it
mostly from where it fell kind of
through
um i believe they transferred that
property over to a university afterwards
but uh to be a big greenhouse but this
is always concern we have is how big of
an environment we need to be closed
and critically with spaceships unless
they're generation ships they don't
actually have to be closed they just
need to
leak or be running out of things that
are difficult to manufacture
slower the duration of the trip so uh of
course what i call it biosphere one is
biosphere one mean orthosphere two being
that environment
um so we always need to do more projects
on that but
for right now we're about as close we
can do sure doing something analytical
amongst itself to check
jonathan kernkamp asks in the video on
superconductors you said that we could
build
larger structures if we implement them
but i don't see how that makes sense
because the load still transfers through
the magnetic field
could you explain because i can't think
of any explanations myself
you're looking for the wrong direction
where i meant by you know to have more
on there
it's not that the superconductor can
hold a vast amount more mass it's that
you can build a much bigger platform
when you're not having to pay the
electric bill of all the wasted energy
with this glue conductor they're not
using the mg up to whole thing in place
neither is any magnet but a magnet is
constantly going to be
leaking um electricity leaking
resistance leaking heat
and superduct was not doing that so
there's no change in the basic mechanics
what's going on there on the
superconductor is vastly more efficient
and therefore you can pay for a larger
megastructure as well
our next question is from the cool shark
hey isaac when you talk about
self-replicating machines you always
seem very confident that it could be
done
with very near-term technology what
would have to happen to make one today
uh with self-working technology we
usually have is the simplest version of
that
um what's called a clanking
self-replicator by the way if anyone was
wondering what just happened the screen
there i
was monkeying out the new widget called
a chat box on here so
i was launching it grab long screen um
a clanking self self-applicator is
notion that you're not bringing title
nanobots
right usually people think
self-upgrading machines from science
fiction they think tiny little things
the size of viruses
or cells but realistically a much easier
uh software okay will probably be
something very large long lines or
factory
clanking self-applicator is more the
idea that you're setting up an entire
in you know industrial chain and what
actually qualifies the thing being
self-replicated gets a little complex at
that point in time but
a factory that was able to have a bunch
of robots who went out and dug things up
or controlled its mind facilities things
like that
that could become a a self-advocating
factor as well that becomes your
clanking replicator
and the other thing to keep in mind with
self-replicating machines it doesn't
actually have to be the entire
chain of production like i am a
self-upgrading machine in theory though
um uh not the same way my cells are
but i don't actually go out and grow in
all my own food i get it packaged from
the store for the most part
um i don't provide all the electricity
lends my lights so a self-locating
machine doesn't actually have to be any
more
self-independent than the circumstance
acquire or what we ourselves be inside
our ecosystem
and that's kind of the notion of can we
do something of that today and the
answer would usually be
yes if we really want to we could but it
would be the most efficient way to do it
um self operating machines come a lot
more easy when you have better
automation in terms of the intelligence
and software
prior to that you're not going to gain
anything from having a factory that's
able to crank out all the little bits it
needs
so that's kind of coming along in stages
we could probably build one today if you
really want to
whether or not be economical or not i
don't know
jhog's 90 says any thoughts on the
proxima signal and the validity of it
being an
actual tech signature uh you know i was
just thinking because i saw uh that
johnny joined us today he'd be a bit of
a guy to answer that question
so i would refer to him and i imagine if
he has already coming on his show he
probably will
uh we were talking about the wow signal
that long ago and uh i don't know if i
actually mentioned it um for those of
you who follow event horizon uh john
michael godier's other show
i was on there as the guest fight we
recorded earlier this month but i would
have been for uh
christmas so that episode would be out
and it's a good thing to go watch after
we're done here on the live stream
it's interesting to see the chats
popping up on the
live stream uh while uh yeah that's a
there's a bit of a difference uh i i
think we lost some of the folks we
usually have this get shifted over the
discord for
mods to put it over there and it's not
usually on the screen in front of me so
i can't see them at all
but i haven't popped up on two separate
screens in front of me over here
one over there on the uh well i'll pop
over first you're wondering about the
other side of things there's they look
at the studio from the other direction
and i think you see the top of sarah's
head over the model and the other model
on the other screen
so um so we all kind of running things
that we go but it's the chat's up on the
screen now
um i know we've had questions from isaac
burdow in the past but today he wants to
know if you like your coffee
and what you think the scariest concept
in science is yeah i do
um i usually especially have usually
some bit of a coffee stop by my friends
but one of my friends is actually a
worst coffee star that means coming over
for dinner tonight so
uh i switched over last year to uh cold
blue coffee i i heat it up still but uh
a lot less acid which is nice on the
stomach but i usually take a dog and
these days a lot of cream and uh
artificial sweeteners so
and there was another question there
that's why i got stretched by coffee
wasn't it
i lost track yeah it was what what you
thought was the scariest concept in
science
oh um hmm
well i i guess entropy by default would
be the scariest one the idea that
everything is going to run down to the
end but
i would generally tend to say that
quantum mechanics was always the most uh
existentially horrifying to me so the
basic idea that things are random and
uncertain is uh
well i'd say it was horrifying to me
when i first found out about it but i
actually tried to
think of it positively these days so
somebody has a question for me they ask
if i'm supportive of the bolo tie or if
you would prefer
a bow tie or more standard tie i would
say any tie except a bow tie i like your
photo
i think that would be good it would kind
of look like dumbo you know get
some big ears coming out around the chin
i very bill nye too
um bill nye the science guy not but we
have a superintendent of the schools
just south of us who's uh
building bill nye too um and uh
it has to be a very small book yeah i i
don't i'm not the bow tie person
but a bolo tie like many things becomes
emblematic with symbolic
given show or enterprise is just by the
suits i saw on amazon one day that was
cute
plus it has a pie symbol mm-hmm saint
lauren beats
says what will be the most important
planets to humanity after earth in the
future
during this during late this century and
early next century
what would be the most excuse me
important planets to humanity
other than earth jupiter um
to something it kind of depends on what
you consider a planet um
but uh jupiter would be the biggest one
in a lot of ways because
it's got all those old moons on it that
have such low gravity get on off of them
and they're all in a nice tight cluster
with each other and
future date during this during late this
century
too many screens up uh so the european
moons
uh europa the other moons of jupiter
maybe titan around saturn too but
in that case it's not really the plants
themselves so much of their moons but
jupiter itself becomes more important to
us in late phases of things too
but i really wouldn't say that either
venus or mars are really important to us
other than their symbolic goals
okay we have a question um
from sian yasar what would it look like
uh to gene edit based on a kardashev one
civilization
uh check back in 20 years i mean we are
so close already to being
able to do that at any what i'd say
economical and useful
level um and we're all getting pretty
close being at k1 in a lot of ways too
it's not that big of a technological
jump you know i don't usually think k1
and k2 is really these
these goals are benchmarks for progress
they all just kind of
states like saying your country hit 100
million people um
your power production hit one gigawatt
that kind of thing but uh
genevine is going to be most useful when
we're actually able to set it up so that
we can edit
someone's entire adult dna strand
prior to that it's mostly useful for
creating new crops new non-human things
because we won't really be using it for
humans much until then
we can edit it in adults voluntarily in
their in its entirety that's what
becomes used for us and that's
got to be i would still say this century
but not towards the end of it um
thank you to out of the blue crafts for
your donation
and also alaskan ballistics and but they
both say i love your channel
alaskan ballistics says i binge watch it
often again and again
um we also had a question
from raven609 why don't we see
your map of lithuania anymore
the map of lithuania oh that black girl
was laughing wasn't it
uh that was a code from uh from agnes
serified actually a friend of mine from
on on the
um she sends me postcards when you
travel i was like getting postcards from
people and almost nobody actually sends
them to me
um new office new studio things get sold
around i think it's probably boxed up
somewhere
um i redecorated yeah well yeah so i
actually did a lot of read that going in
here
uh we i think i'll flick over the webcam
again
since i have both cameras actually up
and live you can see the gigantic
tapestry up behind
where i guess you can see the top of
sarah's head again towards behind the
microphone it's like framed by the
microphone right now
um those are mostly there for um
sound absorption uh by the way since
some of you will probably be joining us
hopefully on facebook this time too we
are trying to simultaneously
cast to facebook live as a quick side
note sarah uh stella
is actually up on discord right now
putting questions in too oh
okay so we have a question here from
uh the real goliath other than common
sense
why do we assume that closed causality
loops are impossible
usually because they don't tend to be
too too coherent when you start
examining them for those of you who
don't know a closed causality loop the
basic idea being that you travel back in
time to do something
that changes the past at war but
essentially causes a closed
loop eg i go back in time to uh
to do something and i uh accidentally
kill my grandfather
and marry my grandmother or have a child
with my grandmother it turns out that i
really was my own grandfather eg that's
the closed loop there
um and uh usually you start plucking
those apart individually they do not
make sense
for repetition you know the cycle
wouldn't be able to continue down that
road
there are all some basic ideas like the
nov nokia
nokia self consistency principle cl time
travel episode
where basically withhold the idea that
if you could travel in time which for
the record i tend to think is impossible
but if you could travel back one in time
that the only changes you could actually
have happen would be those
that caused a consistent future
uh as an example of how that could
happen um
you know a drop of water comes down here
in ohio it does make its way back to the
ocean which path it takes it's hard to
say
it usually will go around the saint
laurent seaway out through the lakes but
it could go so many different ways
but it's going to get its way down there
and only paths that actually result in
it getting down they all need to be
considered
so you might have one way or you went
back in time to save jfk from being
assassinated and you succeed
well now why did you go back and try to
save him in your future again
well because one of the allowable
futures is one where
you have always been lied to about that
or you are insane and believe he was
assassinated still
even though he wasn't unless traveled
back in time and those start getting
kind of absurd but they are
possible so those would be examples of
how the nokia self consistency principle
could allow a close
time loop stellarator thank you so much
for your help we have a question here
from joshua if a dyson swarm was
constructed as close as possible to a
star
in order to lessen the mass budget of a
swarm versus the energy budget
and construct them only around the
smallest stars might that limit
the infrared excess to values that we
see in several galaxies that have been
searched for k-3 civilizations
and moreover
if dyson swarms are used for star
lifting then they might grow
exponentially covering the entire star
in that scenario
we might never spot any dyson swarms at
all
a problem people sometimes have with
things like we call the dyson dilemma
which is
fundamentally what started the show up
is the assumption that the dyson dilemma
itself is really requires that you
specifically do dyson spheres
what it's actually saying is the
growth-based civilization is going to
eventually make use of all of its energy
that can get its hands on
when all the matter can get its hands on
unless and it by the easiest route
possible
so that as long as you can't do certain
things like create yourself
you know a perpetual motion machine or
tap into other universes for power
you're going to use about your local
material in space however
we actually have an episode coming up i
think in late january or early february
called colonizing red dwarfs
that looked at why we were dicing those
up and why we'd have problems with that
which is ironically going to be followed
by three other episodes because it got
to be interesting topic
uh one of which is colonizing giant
stars
and another's killing stars and another
uh exo-stellar civilizations for living
after stars
um the billion dimmest stars in our
galaxy
the the dimmest billion of them are not
as bright
in total as some of the brightest stars
in our galaxy we have individual stars i
wanna talk about supernovas
individual living stars in the main
sequence that are brighter
than the billion dimmest red twelve star
galaxy
um when you're building a dyson sphere
keep that in mind you know
you you have these little dim red
dwarves they're very efficient they'll
keep running for a trillion years
um but they are not that powerful
um and you start dimming start down by
star lift and things like that
you're weaking the power you get out of
it and it might not really want to start
that's going to run for short years
especially when you probably have
something like commercial fusion already
especially have options like potentially
taking apart a star and feeding into a
black hole
um and these are things to be keeping in
mind for these but another thing to keep
in mind is you say
well if we got fusion or if we got black
core based energy we just feed metal
down one
why do we have these stars or why are we
even bothering the stars and say well
you're no longer using stars your power
source so it's still free power so you
might be using it depends on economics
and if they aren't useful for that
you're going to take them apart by that
same technology star lifting or
even putting a black hole into a very
careful orbit around it
um and one of my cats is doing antics on
my
couch at the moment but i will flick
over that while i continue to talk about
that
you can see him he's hiding right behind
the camera this big orange blob
go smiling going back to discussion of
of um feeding metal into black holes
you're still going to get that infrared
central
and why is that that frequency we say
well a red dwarf mostly embeds infrared
too
eventually from its infrared at like the
2000 or 1000 kelvin range uh we in a
minute around 300 kelvin
we might process it down to 30 kelvin
style with the materials
brain the lower the emission the lower
the energy heat
of that involved the more efficiently
extracted energy from the end um and you
want to keep doing that by the next do
you get as cool as possible but it's
very hard to get much cooler than that
yeah you could have all these red dwarfs
bundled up but if you're not actually
seeing them in like the 300 kelvin or
less range that means they're not
involved with biological life will be
300 kelvin
or less and that's kind of the signature
we're looking for
uh james cambius thank you for your
donation
and he says how long would it take to
build a k2 dyson sphere
um then we just do an episode on that
um how long will we do that this week's
episode was low tech called chef two
civilizations
and the idea there being that you would
just be doing something like a chicago
thruster or power satellites
all you're doing is collecting energy uh
at that point in time the question is
how could we keep bootstraps in the ipad
together
and there it's not a question of how
fast you could
like for instance you could come in with
gigantic solar sails to a brand new
solar system
uh that you imported and have the thing
up and running inside a couple years
minus what the travel time was
here we can construct it pretty quick
how fast can you mass produce aluminum
foil
and it basically comes down to how fast
can you grow your need for that power
and you could potentially create a dyson
sphere if you had self-replicating
machines and built up solar system
in i think maybe under a year maybe
under a year by using those decades or
centuries still even way just because
it's
how quickly can you build a house in
theory you can do it a day how quickly
you change styles
ask guys and ask all 13 seconds how long
does it usually take
so andrew lewis says steam turbines have
to he
a heat to work efficiency of around 40
percent
is there any way to get more efficient
intermediate steps so that whatever is
generating the heat has
higher output for the same input
um i mean we got certain types of
turbines that can do over 90 for
instance they're just
mechanical ones right there they're not
heat engines um
usually it's very hard to get anything
about 50 even on paper
uh that that's that may be a
thermodynamics based um
but i don't really see how you could do
much better than we're doing right now
but if we you know again if i could
couple theoretical way to do that
uh i panned it and we have much more
efficient power reactors
so dt phenom says if you had
50 billion dollars in capital what space
or tech startups or projects would you
start and thanks for the videos
you're very welcome uh i was about to
ask if you said 15 or 50 but i think it
makes a difference five zero five zero
fifty billion well that might make a
difference
uh if i had 50 billion dollars
that i could simply put into space
industry development
i think that the big one really would be
trying to prototype an open ring and a
launch loop
um and i especially probably wouldn't
have going through most that might try
to get the prototypes up and running or
something like that
um but i i guess i would probably start
throwing instead
into various ones but we haven't done
the prototypes yet because we tend to
think of them as big capital throw in
with a relatively low success rate so if
i didn't have to
report to congress with it that would
probably will throw an answer would be
a basic opening ring um something with
moon extraction
of creating of either aluminum foil or
something similar to that
and maybe a sky hook
warren park says what do you think our
biggest achievement will be in the next
10 years
um our biggest achievement
in the next 10 years i'm assuming no
one's gonna drop us 50 billion dollars
like to accomplish that yeah
um i would say probably the big one
because because of the crisis when right
now
that always motivates us towards
something um as we start to get out of
this crisis the big one is going to be
let's never have this happen again
you know it's been we've had quite a few
plagues in the last century and 101
years ago we had
like the spanish flu killed 50 million
people i would say the next decade is
all going to be about
um plague prevention as a kind of a
secondary note much same way the last
decade
was very focused on counter-terrorism
concerns for airports
um but i would also say the real big
invention that would have the real big
transition is going to be a lot more
remote work
and all the changes was that you know
when you're working at home
you know you know as an example uh i was
a homeschooler i think a lot of folks
might be more inclined to homeschool if
they were working at home so
people who on into that might shift
around that you might see a lot more
schools
trying to try new programs now in
between steps things like that
but the big thing will be all the remote
walk all the social distancing the
the both benefits and collateral damage
for that in terms of remote work
delivery prevention those would be where
the big thing for the next decade are
going to be in terms of achievements
alexandra seaman says hey isaac in the
far future do you think that gold will
retain its status as the most valuable
precious metal or do you think that
something else will take its place
i mean if we were to remove the ones
that are specifically fissile like
uranium is quite cheap but those could
potentially become very valuable
uh plutonium for instance if we're just
talking the precious metals like copper
palladium silver
uh gold then i would say gold will
probably tend to stay up near the top
but
remember the platinum is usually worth
more than gold a lot of times too and i
believe platinum is too so
it's it's a classic but it's not that
super rare in the universe and
it just becomes which one is going to be
most valued in least rail
do you keep reading lists
i mostly listed keep audio listing lists
and uh interestingly i'm listening to a
book by
one of our editors right now jerry
gerwin um it's a nice fantasy historical
fanta
fiction uh set in the 12th century um
i keep a list of books on our website
skeltho.net
if you go to that you'll see the tab on
there there will be one attempt says
books it's right next to the donate tab
um and that
i haven't updated too much in the last
few months but that does have like all
this so not only book of the months but
almost every book that i thought was
actually worth recommending
yeah manuscript says hi isaac would it
be possible to devote an episode to
going over some of the science fiction
series you would recommend
i've read the entire foundation series
and a lot of asthma and clark
what is next um i mean if you've read
foundation enjoyed it and you had clark
and enjoyed it uh the two users
suggestions for classics
well three um heinlein either uh
starship troopers or stranger strange
ward
uh dune frank called with sirius um
uh or endor's game and speaker for the
dead by
also scott card those are usually your
next go-to's if you're looking at the
big classic ones
and those all three of them are great um
and uh of course great bad baby in there
too
um i don't know we i thought sometimes
about doing something like a sci-fi
sundays or sci-fi saturday show once a
month uh where we just kind of
you know let our hero down and uh talked
about those but
there are people who do review science
fiction like sf debris
um that are really very good lits and
when we talk about it we usually talk
about the science
that connected to that it's like we're
talking foundation series we're really
talking as psycho history
and so we have an episode on psycho
history for instance uh
we might move in that niche at some
point just give it a try you know but uh
i don't really think of us as we are
very science fiction oriented but we're
not really a science fiction review show
so
um we have a question here from mark
zimmerman do you think the population of
earth could realistically ever exceed
10 billion with a b given already
declining birth rates in the developed
world and the decreasing need for humans
in work
they are not declining in the developed
ward that is a very
false assertion people keep making uh
there was like a year where the
population growth in a selected
cherry-picked group of
developed award e.g europe was down uh
people have been repeating this it is
not true
uh developed war itself is also a very
dangerous tone to be using that's
kind of a follow-up for like first world
second or third world the population
this planet has not declined a single
year
uh in my lifetime or to my knowledge in
many generations before that
and uh you start focusing on what the
development is versus what the
undeveloped world is that gets really
tricky uh the populations continue to
rise but even in the
developed waters continue to rise i do
not accept any population estimate data
because every model of my lifetime that
we got to was wrong
and not just a little wrong they've all
been really wrong so
um the population could decline
population growth
rate probably will actually decline a
little bit the growth rate
but uh the idea that the anyone's
predicting like the population would be
9 billion by the year 2060
go back to 1970 and see how uh they
predicted there was going to be at 16
billion by i think 2016.
and uh did we miss that one but uh do
not believe population estimates
they are always wrong almost in the
weather
however if we assume the population was
going to decline
uh which is a possibility of course
there are so many
steps a civilization can take same as if
they're fighting overpopulation and i
think what people tend to forget is that
we took a bunch of those steps
our declining population in the
developed world is largely based off the
fact that we were terrified at the
beginning of the previous century
throughout the middle of the century to
the green revolution that we are going
to
have a massive overpopulation problem so
we began taking a lot of steps to
prevent that we are still in them uh if
we need to reverse those that would not
be a problem
so i don't see any reason why the
population has to
suddenly massively frequently decline i
think that probably is going to keep
raising but
if it does stop it i don't see why it
would stop at nine billion temperature
instantly it stops where
we're comfortable sporting it i'm going
to get three more questions in before
the break and then we're going to come
back
on aliens we have a
donation from brother malachi and he
says have you ever done a video on
legged vehicles such as mecca and the
like
and would any have a practical use in
combat
if not would you consider doing one we
did an episode on laid combat vehicles
it was called power armor and giant
robots
i would say uh we did another one before
that too
i think it was actually introduced to
our space warfare episode was
uh about giant robots but see your
episode giant robots and palo alto
harry garrison says hey would you
consider emergent behavior in an ai to
have reached the point
that it is deserving of rights
what now um oh ai all dumber than like
hummingbirds
um i guess i guess that kind of falls on
on what's
i'm not picking on hobby bullets well it
sure sounded like i like hummingbirds
they have a lot of brain in that little
tiny fluff
they seem very flittery so maybe i okay
apparently i'm biased against
hummingbirds
uh our corn ai
are still dumber than most the animals
that we tend to respect like cats and
dogs
so i asked whether or not they have
rights so you should say with things
like this the question is
what's our current attitude on it with
existing setups eg are you planning on
giving cats or dogs why should cats and
dogs have rides
well if you decide that dogs deserve
rights and i tend to say an ai of the
same intelligence level as them does too
you get something that's as small as a
human then you probably have to be
giving it human rights
and the last question before the break
is from colin cleveland thank you colin
for your donation and he says
spacex sn9 here we come any thoughts
um you know i think they are usually one
of those examples of where i let myself
get very cynical in the past so i never
do anymore
uh when they first started talking about
the reusable rockets over a decade ago
i was one of the many he was like this
isn't going to work i was wrong
uh elon musk has had some terrific
failures
and some terrific successes and spacex
is
one of those and they've had their fair
share failures too they've uh
they just keep getting them out there
and i admire them as much for just keep
going as for their successes
so um yeah i love that rocket launch
i don't want to explode on the pad but
that was still a success i'm looking for
the next one that doesn't
so and i think that if they can get
those running and
even uh even pretty close to what the
cost they suggest is going to be for
those
then you can start thinking about moon
bases inside the next decade or so
if all girls are going to plan
we're gonna go ahead and go to break and
we'll see you in a few minutes so we
will be on break for a couple of minutes
and it's a great time to get in some
more questions to our moderators
or grab yourself a drink and a snack
while we're on break we had an episode
on tale for me a couple weeks
back and afterward i got a number of
questions along the lines of which we
should terraform first
mars or venus or something else with the
suggested something else
usually being either our moon or one of
jupiter's moons
and we explored those options in our
episodes springtime on mars
winter on venus and somewhere on jupiter
and i generally don't know which we
should terraform first
and depends a lot on how far we are
willing to go and what qualifies as
terraforming versus para terraforming
but a common question i get is if the
moon our moon could be terraformed and
the answer is yes
our moon does have enough gravity to
hold an atmosphere so long as we give it
a protective magnetic field
and we talked about how to do that in
the terraforming episode a couple weeks
back
a green moon or blue moon is a popular
idea in science fiction
but usually the softer sorts of sci-fi
like gene wolf's book of the new sun
rather than those series noted for their
scientific realism
however it is doable enough not even
acquiring domi over the whole world
though that would make it much easier
and it would be no easy process either
way
as the world closest to our own as the
only one meaningfully visible from here
the moon might well receive extra
attention efforts which were not really
efficient in time
cost or labor and that might mean
terraforming efforts of the more extreme
kind potentially all the way down to
annie mastura to make it more of a
double planet
alternatively as the world closest to
our own it is also the easiest source of
raw materials
and might well find itself mined out to
build endless ships and orbital habitats
it is always hard to guess what sort of
things a future humanity might be
focused on
for efforts at efficiency or to display
prestige and beauty
on the extreme end of efficiency you
might insist everyone uploads their mind
to computers and waste no processing
power on frivolous endeavors
while on the far side of the other
direction i could imagine civilizations
setting off supernovae to sculpt nebulas
hundreds of light years across
into memorial clouds and art of course
we sometimes wonder if maybe someone has
already done that
if some ancient precursor or
civilization carves some sort of auto
message in a galactic or even universal
scale and we'll contemplate that notion
and others in our first episode of next
year
civilizations at the beginning of time
before that though we'll close out the
year this thursday december 31st with a
look at becoming an interplanetary
species
and now back to our show
and we're back well i promised the
audience that our first question would
be on aliens
and imanresu 56 says if aliens are using
something
similar to an alcubair drive for
interstellar travel
could we potentially detect the
gravitational waves from it
sure um i don't know that would really
give you all that much
if you had a sensitive enough
gravitational protector yes you could
detect it
um but unless you're trying to move
things that are of stellar mass i don't
know that you have very good luck
detecting them
gravitational detectors using alcohol
technology um
absolutely forgotten what's called a
ligo or like a
there's a laser-based uh infrastructure
system we've been using to detect on
earth that's incredibly
sensitive and it lets us pick up things
like
you know black holes bulging which is
the most powerful event in the universe
um
as to actually be able to detect very
small ones
i don't know how we go about doing that
that would be a very valuable detector
but if you had one that was
very good at picking stuff up like that
then yes it would be able to pick up now
could be a warp drive yeah when walking
gear conrad teostorsen thank you very
much for your
very generous gift and he says sarah and
isaac you two are absolutely wonderful
thank you so much for all you do
bin pre-war says how would heat
dissipation work in a dense dyson swarm
wouldn't massive wouldn't the heat from
the massive radiators on each habitat be
absorbed by
others nearby so the heat eventually
reaches the outer habitats
um it would but you have to kind of pass
all the heat and direction you might be
running heat engines on that for that
metal too
you have that ultimate limitation of how
fast you can radiate off your surface
into a vacuum
and so if you want to do a multi-layered
thing like a multi-mckendree cylinder
for instance
um you could have a huge amount of
radiators on that something like the uh
forest or fractal radiate obelisk that
we talked about in matriarchal worlds
but at a certain point you start saying
instead of building these
huge surface area crinkly structures um
that you're going to just make a just
going to make more of them with fewer
layers
and there's probably a kind of a price
point if you would uh where you say
maybe four layers is enough and it
reverses on crinkly surface
and we're going to cut down on after
that but i don't say
don't assume too much that when we're
talking about doing like shell boards of
earth's
or you know soak your things like onion
o'neill sonos that you're actually
having multiple independent layers
that are the whole way around i think in
a lot of cases you kind of have a
halfway set up or
just in some cases like 100 layers in
one spot similar to a skyscraper only
very wide
um and uh in that kind of context you're
gonna do like heat pumping regardless so
assume there was a basically a maximum
convenient amount
of internal value area that you would
say
at this point it's easy to make another
structure
corbin mcbride says hi isaac and sarah i
love the quality content you
are providing us with i wanted to know
if you see star uplifting being our
ultimate goal
and whether you see harvesting other
planets besides mercury
i don't think we did in the parking
anything other than mercury if we even
do mercury
just because if someone's actually set
up camp on a place like mall or sorts of
camp on a place like venus
i in this solar system that's uh i don't
think that you'd be able to actually get
anyone who was willing to take it apart
after especially keep selling the
resources and little bits for
you know a million billion years um
i think that you might see some place
like mercury taken apart but when you
get outside the solar system
i think that in general whatever is not
really being valued as plans for livion
those will just tend to get disassembled
uh almost from the get-go but you always
start your low-hanging fruits your
asteroids then you move on to your moons
then your smaller plants and your larger
plants in your store itself
space shuttle atlantis says hey isaac do
you think an artificial
superintelligence could help us find and
get us on talking terms with aliens if
we have such technology by the time of
first contact um
i think that well i always
tend to think it's a really bad idea to
consider building a general intelligence
that's super
intelligent compared to whatever the
norm was for humans at the time but
an artificial intelligence would be a
very good approach to creating something
like a universal translator
and not just uh in the classic sense of
trying to take apart a language that we
didn't know
but even just for doing random
translations if you use a lot of
translators
um they do some interesting translations
uh there's entire
comedy sites devoted to bad translations
and uh and artificial intelligence might
be a very good way to deal with
those kind of translations that we have
just with known language so why wouldn't
you be super intelligent to do it better
than we are doing it these days
um but it could potentially do a very
handy job on that
um of course there's pretty good chance
you're talking to aliens and you have a
superintelligent ai
you're also talking to an alien ai to
begin with
otter tv says when do you think we might
start building a permanent moon base i
think we might have answered that
question in the last
live stream as well but um i mean
there's always question what the
benchmark is
there's no point going back to the moon
with people unless you're doing it with
the intent of setting up a opponent base
i mean maybe you're going there to kind
of check it out for six months something
like that
that would be okay but my general
philosophy is you don't do a moon base
again until you're ready to stay there
um you know you might be ready to take
off you need to but
we don't go back to the moon with people
until we plan to stay there
and that could be as soon as 10 years
honestly if if spacex's new rocket works
as well as planned they can roll it out
fast enough then yes
that is on the table i tell ten i think
that's optimistic
but that's because we haven't had people
on the moon my entire lifetime
so you know it does make one just a
little bit shaded
mercurian brachy scrone trajectories
ltd uh thank you for your donation and
he
asks could we build a lunar rotavator
using starship
yeah you could do with sky hook on the
one uh one nice thing about sky hooks
uh on all these moons and other things
like that is they work very well
so this thing is round enough you could
actually have a relatively circular
orbit over top of it
uh in that case because they don't have
an atmosphere you can spring very low i
mean you could spring down grass will be
out the pad
if you have the pad on the highest point
the orbit like if it was a circle over
around the planets and you the
pickup pad was on top of a mountain or
something that was relatively high there
this skyhook can grab it right off the
ground um
but uh the one public doing things like
skyhooks on places like the moon or a
place of lower gravity
with no atmosphere is you start
wondering why you don't just do a very
long
you know rail gun or quail gun or
space catapult on the ground and just
angles out
simon fowler welcome farmer sorry simon
farmer welcome back
thank you for your donation again as
well
he says plutonium in
oh gosh i can't pronounce this
purslabuski's
piloski's star yeah that one i think i'm
just pronouncing it too but uh start
questions with the old style
okay so anyway the plutonium and that
hard to pronounce star that you just
said
narrow hand signals from proxima
centauri where is your personal
definition of extraordinary evidence
uh
extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence well here's the
thing is
whenever you're looking for signs of
something that's a definite sign of life
were you telling me straight in my head
by the way okay i sometimes get feedback
from my wife it looked like she was
sticking a tug out at me there which i
thought
oh ah
i'm open son assignment by the way is
one of the names i actually recognized
from the early days of the show simon
farmware i think he's been with us since
season 102. so hi
simon um okay so what qualifies evidence
of intelligence
if you hit from two different angles
that's pretty much always what it's
going to be for me on these things
where would they get the fermi paradox
where they usually say is intelligence
recognized intelligence
you can find one lone hammer in the in
the woods and say wow that's from an
intelligent civilization
or maybe it's not maybe it's a weathered
down rock that's hammer-shaped
the thing is when you're fighting
civilizations you probably are not going
to find
one artifact one sign
and it's you know you're not going to
mistake new york city as a random object
but that's what you're probably going to
find right the first thing you'll find
if you come to earth uh
is a ridiculous number of signs there's
intelligence here
and if all you can find is one thing
that's debatable that
might be sign of intelligence or might
be sign of civilization
and nothing else then it probably isn't
uh otherwise if it's one of those cases
where
you know if it was a signal it was like
a television signal from an alien planet
we wouldn't be debating
at all if it was maybe uh a sign of life
or not we'd say well yeah there we go
spaceship lands in the front lot of the
white house you don't say that might be
alien
or it might be a random asteroid you
know
so that tends to be my attitude on those
things
ray springs says have you read about sir
roger penrose's objection reduction
idea and his and hameroff's work or
extension about consciousness the basic
notion
of that one for oracle for instance um
and uh actually you and i had a
conversation about that way back in 2016
at dave shoulders house
uh is can the brain be quantum uh is the
brain quantum and the answer of course
is yes the means quantum
everything is quantum uh the brain is at
a smaller scale
that quantum events can affect your
thinking minimally right uh the closer
you get to the quantum scale the more
likely quantum
effects are to actually bubble up the
macroscopic or that scale
so a quantum event bubbling up to our
level
very hard to do bubbling up to like the
cellular level or the neuron level
still very rare but it does occasionally
happen you won't be able to predict
everything a human brain is going to do
weighs out no matter how good your
machinery is uh because there will be a
quantum effect somewhere in there that
you could have predicted that you know
there's
got 100 billion neurons every so often
whether it's going to have a slight
tweak to what we've done based on a
quantum
phenomena now as to whether or not
consciousness is something that takes
place the quantum scale
um that's a lot harder to argue and of
course you have to start by deciding
what is consciousness you know it's kind
of like
uh one of those questions where you want
to be careful how you define it
uh as an example quantum mechanics often
uses an indication that such thing as
free will
now i tend to assume there is free will
i don't even waste my time considering
universal which free will does not exist
however quantum mechanics and randomness
uncertainty are not
themselves indications that free will
exist
because simply events being random does
not necessarily mean that you have free
will
any more than a coin does so uh i would
say there was probably quantum
aspects of consciousness but i wouldn't
really say that that that that is a
feature of the quantum level
amelia celante says do you think that
the energy requirements of wormholes
would depend upon the size and not the
distance
could you move whole planets and even
stars with a big enough wormhole if you
had the energy
um well the interesting thing about it
is is the
theories for how to make a wormhole
prior to a couple of ones that are very
very uh iffy on on the basic math but
their basic whirlpool concept
usually requires several solar masses to
build um
and you could transport a plant through
them very easily because they had plenty
of space for it
the idea there of course is can you make
a um a neck
a stable neck they can get these don't
get crushed going down and that's what
requires your negative matter
i don't believe in they gonna matter so
i don't think you're going to actually
get one of those to walk
but um they are your throat
uh or your master that one more that is
the controlling factor
how much mass it has is the uh how big
an object in transport
connected they are distance shouldn't
map at all so
but that's again an assumption of a lot
of theory there
gancio the ranter says hi sarah and
isaac do you think that a complex human
civilization could collapse due to the
degrading social cohesion related to
transhumanism
and would baseline humans post i'm sorry
would baseline humans
trust post-human entities do you trust
people who are smaller than you
uh is the question though that depends
yeah yeah yeah
that's that's the answer that question
too is diversity
something that causes civilizations to
collapse and that's the other question
there
um and of course the answer there is it
depends too
does diversity cause empires to fall
sometimes they do
fall from that whether or not that's a
bad thing it's a little bit debatable
um one might say that rome fell from
divorce award but i don't know that i
say was a bad thing
uh did green hair versus pink hair and
people you know dye their hair whatever
color they wanted to
cause civilizations to collapse probably
not um
it's gonna depend on what the change is
when you're talking about transhumanism
that can be something as simple as we no
longer have people missing arms or legs
that might be something as simple as now
people can see in the infrared range
you know ultraviolet it might mean they
think a little bit smarter
could that cause the civilization to
collapse absolutely uh would it
i don't know i don't know we have a
question from colt
actually it's the several questions he
says is the u.s navy patent for an
electro-gravity
anti-gravity vessel viable from a
physics standpoint
this question has bugged me for ages but
i lack the knowledge to come to my own
conclusion
um i don't believe that
you can actually have any anti-gravity
advice divided that folks tend to talk
about and those circles i don't believe
the navy's has one of these to be honest
um
it would already be out there in use if
it was but uh
a thing to keep in mind with a lot of
patents the military does or doesn't
have or that you hear about them is just
because the military is patented
something doesn't mean it actually walks
um and uh just because people say the
military's patented something doesn't
mean they actually have
but i am not familiar with any
anti-gravity devices that have been
demonstrated to walk
and that is to be always the proof of
the pudding barry j
burns has a question on the fermi
paradox since we're looking into the
past when we look farther out
life that started at the same time of us
wouldn't be visible what do you say
well if something had uh popped up in
the andromeda galaxy
even 1.9 million years ahead of us it
wouldn't be visible because it's two
million
light years away the problem here and i
understand what comes up with this
um universe is listed to be 13.8 billion
years old last estimate
uh our planet is 4 billion years old and
changed last estimate and we should have
had plans similar to our own popping up
at least six to ten billion years ago
last current estimates um all galaxies a
hundred thousand light years across
so you know if anything had popped up in
that time it should be visible
you start going to a galaxy and say well
now the sample is even bigger there's no
no galaxy but maybe there's one in
neighboring galaxy well it's two million
light years away
two million light years is nothing
compared to their billion years
so we go out to a bigger distance the
value of space in the galaxy in it
loosely rises with the cube of that
distance so if i look out twice as far
there are eight times as many potential
civilizations i will got 10 times as far
they are now a thousand times many
civilizations so if i was expecting to
find one in a 10 million light year area
and i now look out to a billion light
year area where plants might start to be
thinning out at that point a billion
years of the past
i know being a hundred times more than
that with a million times many galaxies
in it that kind of math that curve
doesn't work out the volume is rising
that fast
you look three billion light years away
and you don't see anything then you can
start saying well maybe it's too soon
fleeing civilizations terrorism
that's usually why i say with the dyson
dilemma i don't think it's very likely
based on that that there's any
civilizations within a billion light
years of us
because it seems like if there was one
within say half a billion that it just
was 499 million years ago and wasn't
quite visible yet
then there should be at least one in a
volume 100 times bigger than that
that's just a little bit older when we
inside that car
because there's so many more options
there
we have a question from saint lauren
beets again
do you believe that ray kurzweil even
with his nearly 90
prediction accuracy rate that we will
have the singularity around
2045. i don't think he would claim he
has a 90
production accuracy um
for a while when this show was
transitioning from being a hobby to your
profession i
joked about what i should put on my
business card and i thought about
playing professional c or i'm right 51
of the time um i've always had a great
deal of admiration for that man he is a
very good at predicting things
and i cannot imagine he would ever claim
he was accurate 90 of the time
so um he's made uh quite a few
bad guesses um some which i agreed with
him was wrong about too
um but uh he yeah i
i don't think you could say that he was
accurate 90 of the time um
is he good at making guesses yes uh has
he been off on some things oh yeah
um predictions about you know for
instance voice control of computers it
was one of what's always popped in my
head because
i thought it'd be a very likely one too
but was more pessimistic because of my
speech impediment
i thought it would be very unlikely as
generation after generation of uh speech
tech software failed
that they would actually meet the
deadline of all these optical all these
various devices being controlled by
voice
as nothing ever seemed to work for me
but um
little tiny things can throw off
predictions um and he makes some good
ones but about the singularity
i've always thought that one required
too many assumptions on the first being
that the
you know moore's law is a real formula
that computers are always going to
double that's not actually moore's law
but that's what amounts to that they're
double
every x number of years well they don't
right the follow-up on that is that you
also have to assume that an ai for
self-learning
is going to be able to make a smarter
computer than itself
well i'm a self-learning machine so you
when was the last time you made an ai
smarter than yourself
by yourself and then the other contact
of the singularity like that is they
could do it faster each time round
they can make a smarter one each time
and that's iffy and you have to have all
three of those to really get the
singularity that people tend to talk
about
and it has happened fast so that you
have the parallel
things that are almost as good out there
that's where i tend to think that that
notion of that particular version of
singularity
is wrong there are other versions of it
uh but that sends me the one that people
tend to think
of by default hiteshkar
says hey isaac would alien civilizations
be willing to share their knowledge of
the universe with us humans considering
we still have a long ways to go to
understand true physics
more time please hey isaac would alien
civilizations be willing to share their
knowledge of the universe with us humans
considering we still have a long ways to
go to understand true physics
nope aliens will not share the signs
with us because they do not
you know that because they either they
don't do it and they don't want to share
it
or they don't exist and what she's not
going to share with us i'd share with
another civilization i don't
support the prime directive in star trek
at all i do support the basic notion
that you you know keep your nose at
other people's business right it's it's
not you're gonna do yourself
other people much good to be jumping in
everywhere else war
but at the same time um you know i i
i would not let an asteroid class and
crash into a print of alien planet
and i wouldn't let a plague wipe them
out either you know i don't know i'd
always get my nose too heavily involved
in that but
um i i don't think there's some slippery
sloping algae's there but uh i'd rather
those slippery slopes were
ethical slopes not ones covered in the
blood of innocent people who died
because i didn't feel like getting
involved
and uh i don't think aliens would tend
to all feel the same on that issue and
so
if they're out there in mass they should
be sharing their technology with us so
a they don't exist or b they're not in a
position to share it with us
either because it's ethically wrong or
just not practical as they fall away
alexander karl says which planet or moon
within the solar system would you like
to
explore in person the most in person
oh um most of the interesting things is
the solar system
on this planet uh the tallest moon uh
soros mountains on mars
but it's not really the the the
struggling climate people tend to think
of is when they say oh that thing's
two and a half times better than mount
everest it's also much much wider than
mount everest you could stroll up it
even if it wasn't known off gravity but
it's on lower motion gravity so it's not
much of a hike
um and uh
there are a lot of very interesting
features in our solar system they really
are you could go cloud sailing on
venus you know or you know jupiter and
we looked at that in our
space tourism episode but uh for the
most part authors with a lot of
interesting stuff is that
i'd like to explore i really have no
desire personally to go visiting these
things
so since you're talking about mars jim
matterhorn says hey isaac if we discover
life on mars should we stop future
settlement
efforts
tricky um it depends on what we find
there um
any place we find life period right now
we want to be very careful not to damage
that life because of the scientific
value of it but if we found life there
like wow this is
almost exactly the same as an earth
lichen
uh then we have to sort of possibly that
it might actually be or if liking that
got transported vice versa
um if all we find is we go out in the
universe's various types of like in lj
once we've had a chance to take a sample
of them take some good samples and make
sure we've exhausted they found all
those samples and analyzed them
i don't really personally see all that
much value in
um you know liking that i preserve a
whole planet as an ancient absorbed word
on the other hand we got all these
things that we find that's got like
dinosaurs or cats or
anything that will qualify as like an
intelligent thinking or really complex
life form yes preserve that
uh maybe not on the planet though maybe
you put into a rotating habitat
i tend to think that it's much easier in
the long term to maintain quarantine
inside a closed cylinder uh where you
can put it wherever you want and inside
our planet especially with all the
resources the planet
represents the rio goliath asks what are
the odds that once the whole galaxy is
colonized we will forget which planet we
came from
like we see in the foundation series i
always kind of like that was a
play-around notion is uh how far in the
future is that happening and say well
data's cheap should be so easy to
remember where you come from
um especially though you might not be
able to do archaeology because there
might not be
a plan or to uh to excavate on that
point
um you should have no problem
maintaining copies of records that long
but
you think about what are the odds over
the course of the next million years
you'll have a plan where people decide
to rewrite history so that they or the
you know at least on that plan they're
the ones who claim to be the first
species what are the odds if we say
that's a 50 50 chance would happen once
on a planet in a million year period
how long does it take for almost every
planet in the galaxy has now made that
claim a billion years
and so it's not the idea that you might
have um you know not
they've lost the data but you might have
somebody false or revised or or
you know changed around fake histories
competing for that title that
you might be able to lose that
information but truth be told i don't
think that you would but
not not something that elementary but
it's possible to remember you know
you're not going to lose the data the
way we used to in terms of records
getting lost
use the records data because there's so
many other records they'll false for one
reason or another
simon the blind thank you for your very
generous contribution
and he says thank you for the amazing
content it's made for some terrific
binging while i wait out some medical
issues i wish i had a question but as
someone who once took star trek as hard
sci-fi
i'm still wrapping my brain around most
of these concepts
um thank you very much i hope you feel
better soon that your your medical
situation is working out well
um last night i watched encounter at
fall point that is the first episode of
star trek
the next generation and the one with the
childhood hard to keep the science solid
at one point in there they're docking
the bottom half the enterprise the the
top half the enterprise something only
does a few times the series uh
it's a cool feature don't use much at
one point uh captain reicho says
um our velocity is are zero we'll let
our north shore tear us through
you know and then it should you know
it's going to glide forward and dock
of course if your velocity is zero you
don't have any you know i'm sure you're
not moving
so um they were always very bad about
checking
their science on those things um and
basically the comparison was how they
stack up to something like
star wars or flash gordon and uh i would
i would never call star trek hard
science fiction
it's one of my favorites i mean i could
probably say the same about stargates
here i love stargate and they are better
about than star
wars was or star trek but you know a lot
of sci-fi shows are never gonna be good
on hard sci-fi and that's probably okay
but uh it makes it fun to learn about
them you get to enjoy the episode for
itself and you get to enjoy it by going
what what's up on that walks
another generous donation from tom
michael and he says hi
isaac thanks for the great shows what
are your thoughts on sci-fi that deals
with the cyberpunk
ideology knowing that populations have
been dropping in size over the past
years and the trend is still rapidly
going down
the population as i mentioned earlier is
that ecuador
and again um the cyberpunk
oh the cyberpunk genre um my favorite
movie is blade runner
the original uh i was i did enjoy the
sequel they eventually did torn out
later on 247 but
not the same thing um i love the shadow
from genre it's a great one
it's very dystopian but um
you don't have to think that something
is uh um
you know uh prophetic to believe that
it's fun to watch
but at the same time um i don't think
the cyberpunk genre is really where
we're going to expect the world to be
um over 40k for that at all and so
it's always a good one although if
you're getting into cyberpunk by the way
i'd recommend blade runner i'd recommend
neil stevenson's uh book snow crash and
uh will uh william gibson's no matter
series 2 but
uh before we close out for today uh
hopefully everyone's been able to see
the comments coming up on the screen
this is my first time trying that out
i probably need to change it around so
the background is not white
um and it hopefully was popping up as
people went by when they were donating
to things
and uh and subscribing but we'll be
playing around with that some new
features with new software that's
available for us on uh
streamlabs ops uh we'll be this our last
live stream for the year not our last
episode we still have
one more to go and uh on december 31st
and then of course we'll start the year
back up uh with civilizations at the
beginning of time on january 7th
so if i didn't get your questions today

new software too and then some people
wait for the holidays to help out uh
