good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly livestream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window so our
moderators can start relaying those to
me as soon as we start please try to
keep the questions concise and watch
your spelling and try to be polite to
others in the chat
we usually go for about an hour so you
probably want to grab a drink and a
snack though we'll take a break about
halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
oops
well on camera stuff but there's always
some glitch five seconds before we start
the episode so good afternoon everybody
and welcome to episode i believe it's 39
live stream 39 where we still haven't
ironed out all of our glitches to begin
the show because we only do it once a
month hello everybody and welcome to
science and futurism with isaac arthur
for our monthly live stream q a we'll be
getting to all of your questions in just
a moment please get them into the chat
window and the person who showed which
second we began is my wife the lovely
sailor fellow author who will be asking
questions of us today as we go through
so get your questions through the mods
they relate in a she'll ask them
me and i will hopefully give us some
sort of halfway same answer we have one
from last month we'll go ahead get
started with yes so
we had a question related
a new
discovered fungus from dewal and thank
you duval for your super chat last month
and his question was
about this fungus that was discovered in
russia that is said to consume radiation
and
he wants to know if there could be any
uses for that organism and we were
looking this up and there's actually a
couple different names and it can block
radiation and it's
being projected as having implications
for future space missions and i actually
had a chance to uh somewhat
coincidentally since now and last month
chat with somebody from nasa ames who
actually was working on this project uh
chris marrow himself from red house
studio uh he's been working
with nasa ames develop a
fungi and microcultural uh building
block that they're actually using right
now in namibia to help build houses but
it's being prototyped for use on the
moon inside
thin pockets where they grow like uh lj
then you know when that is ready to go
they'll harvest that try it out grow
mushrooms on it grab that and compress
it to blocks they call it microblocks so
that is actually a really cool topic
we're gonna be looking at more in about
two months because inspired me to write
a script called self-growing habitats
and um
also i'll be getting a chance to do the
keynote speech uh for the biomimicry bio
scene discussion uh at nasa glenn here
in may not too long after that uh
episode comes out but uh
it's a really kind of cool area to think
that these
kind of mutant funguses you really
wouldn't expect to be around so much
although a lot of them are also
naturally going to uh these mountain
rich ones can actually have this kind of
role in helping protect us from ionizing
radiation and uh this is the big missing
factor in social space conversation all
the time is
we say space is empty it's a space is
full of lot of empty space but this is
not true it's empty of everything nice
it's full of dangerous radiation so
anything we can do to kind of cut down
on those ones is is really helpful you
can use like magnetic fields to help
deflect particles that are ionized
mass particles such as solar wind but
they won't do anything against x-rays
and gamma to those in uv you just got to
use
raw masks to absorb them and so
these more melon rich organisms might be
very useful for that
so
um
i had been perusing facebook right
before we jumped on here and i saw this
meme that said
that uh
sorry i'm pulling it up i think that the
alien ufos are just billionaires from
other planets and i thought that was
hilarious because we have a question
from
micah wanting to know if
that you think that technological alien
civilizations also get a drink and a
snack before settling into your science
program
we are going to be here for about an
hour or two so this is a great time
beginning at drinking a snack i think um
is a weird aspect of for those of us who
live in like the 80s and 90s we missed
apollo we missed all the fun apollo
missions but
we uh you know we kind of got that into
the shuttle program that kind of
disappointed with things not happening
and then we have this big boom of it in
the 2010s that is really a lot of this
is folks like bezos and musk kind of
pushing for that space development and
um
i don't think that they are are
uh the actual ufo signs in question i
can't say for sure
um but at the same time i really
would not be surprised if personal
spacecraft for a very long time to come
are probably going to be limited to
folks in that kind of class range um
well we're talking about that though uh
one of things we have going on in the
background today is that we're going to
be doing and i mentioned the end of last
episode on thursday we're going to be
collecting topics for the return of the
outward bound series we've got some
episodes on mars and the moon coming up
the next month or two and it's made me
feel like i'd like to spend a little bit
more time on that series again because
it's been off outside for a bit
and those who remember that that's like
colonizing moles colonizing mercury
colonizing pluto colonizing saturn
colonizing a lot of things and the thing
is we still didn't actually finish out
our the solar system let alone anything
outside the solar system sites kind of
technically the oort cloud and alpha
centauri um and so today at the end of
the live stream uh probably with a
minute or two delay at least though
we're going to take the five most
popular interesting suggestions from the
audience today and put those up on a
poll over on our community tab for
everybody to go vote on and so we'll
pick out whichever one of those is most
popular do as an episode
and then uh that will be uh so in the
background say where you submitting
those submit your ideas uh and when
people say they like them say things
about how much you like that topic if
you do so that syndry and some of those
who are on the moderation forum can see
them pull them out and uh let me know
about them
all right so um one other announcement
we actually have quite a few for today i
did want to go ahead and give our best
to paul schlitto from curious droid
uh for those of you who remember we did
an episode together on uh mars
colonization maybe
three or four years ago uh he just came
out yesterday announcing he'd been kind
of
um i'm not around as much with his
channel of late because he's been
battling prostate cancer and it looks
like he's winning that battle now this
point in time but just imagine we have a
lot of curious droid fans the audience
you know make sure to pop over his
channel give him your best luck and best
wishes and
believe it or not no matter how many
messages you might get as a youtube uh
you know channel creator you always love
hearing that bits of good news they
really do cheer up your day so
um you know we're wishing him all the
best he's a really good guy you know
on and off camera one thing i like about
youtube is most people i meet and talk
to they are exactly like they all on
camera they all just nice people so
all right back to your questions
so kellen wong wants to know what you
expect a matryoshka brain ai to be like
in terms of personality and interaction
with humans
and the critical thinking about a
master's conveyance i almost never
really think of it as having a
personality um
it's
only a very little bit of hyperbole to
say that that's about the closest thing
to god you can create in a finite
universe because of course you could do
a bigger scale thing like a k3 brain
instead of a kt1 for those who don't
know a matriarchal brain is a
hypothetical computer that
uh in simplest form you build a big old
wad of solar collectors around the
entire sun and of course the sun emits
about two billion times the solar power
that ortho sees in a good moment that's
a lot of electricity running a computer
that's two billion times that you can
run with just this planet um and then of
course we don't really use nearly as
much power to run our computer systems
as we do the plan so you're looking at
something that's
at least without any improvements in
technology a billion billion times
faster than all of our current computing
combined without any technological
improvements on a panels or computing
power
um and uh the matriarchal part the mini
layer dollar effect has the idea that
you're recycling to even do better than
that by you know maybe a factor of 10 by
doing mini nested layers but
fundamentally it's it's a star brain
it's a computer powered by an entire
star
and the idea is that that was an
artificial intelligence it would be
insanely powerful you know and uh we
don't get to see too many actual looks
of those
one of the best i think was um
in isaac asthma's uh short story uh last
answer not excused with last question
which is more famous
and also features a really small
computer uh in uh last ansel
they have seen together all the
computers in the whole galaxy by
hyperspace they can all talk to each
other instantly so they can ask it the
very important deep thought style
question
of uh you know to the computer they say
to it multivac is there a god and one of
the guys is busy trying to unplug the
computer can see something that's going
wrong and he gets hit by a board of
lightning and it says yes now there is a
god so the
scale that we talk about when we talk
about mature brains is sort of a scale
wheel
you know unless you're doing kind of
like the the old school pantheonistic
greek gods you're not really expecting
to see what we think of as a personality
um now in terms of being around
simulated people we usually could run
something like a trillion trillion
trillion uh simulated minds at the usual
estimates for what she does simulate a
human they're just insanely powerful so
i don't really tend to think of them as
personalities so much as just really big
computers you put other stuff on seems
like a planet you know
um but in terms of spirit personality i
don't know
uh probably pretty impressive whenever i
wanted to be
okay so the next question here is from
tumen and he says so do you think that
an artificial intelligence programmed
from the ground up and not with machine
learning or a copied human mind
could be
philosophical make up a fictional story
or think abstractly
we would tend to assume why the the
question on all this stuff is
how do you tell if something really is a
person uh if it cracks like a duck and
it walks like a duck and it sounds like
a duck uh and at what point in time are
you basically just kind of
splitting hails to find this excuse
and what i usually tell people on this
one is obviously one we'll have to wait
and see i think that's gonna be really
obvious if something does or doesn't
but um
if you from a practical standpoint right
are trying to determine what qualifies
as a person
i think it generally behooves you to
state that once something's reached a
certain you know probable cause the
claim is a human so not like a toaster
but you know somebody that can actually
indicate in some fashion probably is
thinking
uh
you probably want to put the burden of
proof on those who are trying to say it
isn't a person at that point you
wouldn't really expect something to
prove it's a person it makes a decent
case or application of why is a
personality why is you know
deserving of being treated just like
anybody else and then you have a a high
border proof to prove that it is not i
say that just because almost every time
i see them try to put together
qualifications what qualifies as a human
or a person um
you end up excluding a lot of people you
tend to think you probably shouldn't be
excluded also you get in category so
um
i don't think we know until we actually
build some of these things if we really
could be something they could write
creatively or
put together poetry or things like that
but that shouldn't really be your
definition anyway because
i know a lot of people who cannot you
know write creatively or do poetry too
and you know they just started coming
out a few years back with these articles
that would write themselves essentially
through the computer basis and
some of them are
very imperceptibly different from
something that a
person is writing i mean you could argue
that it's got presets but
it makes it a little bit blurrier and i
mean we can again make the joke that
really is just indicative of what the
usual quality of people's writing tends
to be but well yes you can't you know
like um i have a lot of friends who
uh you know when i was the only or when
i was teaching way back in college it
was uh you know they showed me something
they'd written or calculated it was
cringeworthy it's like
uh you managed to in one case that
somebody misspelled every single word in
a
i include his own name
um and yet there's no doubt that person
was a person i i wasn't talking to a
random unless we're getting to
a very very solid sister case not
talking to a doorknob or something as a
person so we don't really want to set
the stamp too high and again we have a
lot of ai who uh who can definitely
mimic those skills so again it's
um we don't really want to be assuming
that that's the qualification for
humanity
all right we have a couple other
questions here on artificial
intelligence thought criminal wants to
know what you think of artificial wombs
and how far away is the technology and
how will it impact society both elon
musk and vitalik buterin were talking
about artificial rooms recently
wounds w
okay yeah we were talking about that
recently too
uh my usual joke about this we always
have this image of um you know like um
things growing a big glass tank like
luke star walk the skywalker in star
wars
um and uh he's getting healed up after
his encounter with darth vader on the
ice planet of hoth
and um
you know that's our image like a growth
tank or cloning tank in practice it's
more likely to be a big big ziploc bag
like we call
clone sheep and other things
um and yeah
the thing to remember is that artificial
rooms is a technology that solves a lot
of problems like a lot of technologies
in medicine
you use it to deal with the deficiencies
force to special cases and problems
um you know if you have someone who's
having problems carrying the tom
uh repeatedly you might say well let's
go ahead and do the fertilized embryo
the earlier remove it and put it into an
artificial room where we can grow things
in the hospital you know here is your
child
safely where we are even moderate 100 of
the time
but that needs to be very popular um
you might have examples like well i i'm
about to deploy to a war zone i just got
pregnant uh i want my child but i want
to go do my duty too so they might that
might be a case of artificial rooms
there's a million little cases or
something like that might be useful and
then as that technology improves it can
be useful you think of as more elective
uh situations someone just doesn't want
to be pregnant uh and i don't know that
saying i mean someone would be a bad
parent if they just didn't want to be
pregnant you know um or
there's a million little cases that
could be very handy to do and i think
that that's a technology therefore that
we will see definitely grow very quickly
once you hit that
reasonable success and comfort zone that
lets the snowball begin
xgc hey isaac i love your videos you're
my favorite sci-fi channel i have two
questions one will you do a video on
dark energy technologies similar to the
dark matter one
no
and two
a video on probability manipulation um
you know i was just thinking that we did
the big rip episode and well that's
really more the phantom energy variation
of dark energy um that is really hard to
talk about dark energy technologies
because there's just
um uh
i just realized the cam was slightly off
the side of my computer model isn't it
okay we'll come back to that um but uh
oh my god i just lost my train of
thought matter dark energy technology so
we did the dark matter technologies one
we know a lot about dark matter except
for what it is
so i could do some discussion of that
with dark energy all we know is what it
does
and so it's kind of hard to really
speculate much about technologies for
that but we might do one at some point
um
part two that question was infinite
probability issues
um in douglas adams classic hitchhiker's
guide to galaxy where we find out the
answer to life the universe and
everything is
42 42.
i've been saturating say oh sci-fi since
we started dating um and um
in there they have something called the
finite probability calculator uh which
is it's able to make anything with a
certain finite probability that you know
take place the infinite probability uh
drive is a variation that used for the
show but we did an episode on that
called infinite and probability issues
it's famously the one with the quantum
cheeseburger which was randomly selected
although i'm grateful what i suppose the
other options was for the quantum salad
the quantum chimichanga um and a couple
other lunch items too but we actually
randomly select that title for that so
all right um that's a good one to see
for that issue we might revisit again
though because it's just fun
law of improbability asks how are space
blockades likely to work
obviously things involving a bit more
scale in 3d but identifying what can be
blocked seems fundamentally different
i think we would talk about like a
blockade in the context of an armada but
first are we trying to keep people from
leaving a planet like the ships from
looking at the star wars that power
strikes back that we're trying to flee
up
uh or are they trying to land in the
plant that's been blockaded
and uh your first and and biggest issue
with that is that
uh
you have to ask what is the purpose to
blockade
if you're trying to keep out information
that's a very different type of blockade
it's very hard to
lock out a laser beam that's why it's a
pencil coming from an unknown location
you know that's sending information
let's say i could be a completely
different solar system and i just use
one bouncing location between me and my
destination to send them a signal just
by moving with that bouncing spots out
that tiny little satellite i can aim a
little pencil sized uh laser beam full
of information at a planet and get them
all the info they could ever need right
you can't info embargo sort of putting
around a shelter on the planet which is
possible you might do a shell not a
planet a thin layer of solar panels for
instance or something uh blocky against
people getting in resources we say well
you know how they could
out
we're succeed to keep them from getting
food and medical supplies
um
i don't think that's ever going to work
on any civilization that's actually able
to colonize planets because how do you
starve an entire planet out i mean let's
say somebody blocked us right now
the effect would be what
all right so we do want to be careful
all these contests we talked about
embargoes i think you'd be much likely
to see something like that um as a
guy something you don't own your certain
habitat in that case you still have to
do a complete englavement but you might
actually do that you might do the big
inflated shell around the thing that
just blocks everything coming in and out
and that seems like that would be the
path to go
all right channel favorite albert
jackinson says hey isaac given all the
advances in technology you talk about
here especially for everyday people what
do you expect is the next next for
forensics in the next century or later
could you ask that again i got
distracted trying to move some of its
previous questions so
he has had many questions he wants to
know about next forensic advances
forensic
there foreign certain names that you're
doing the show longer you start
recognizing the comments a lot more
often i think you and i've actually
spoken sometimes we've got the discord
chat too
but um
we have some folks who are actually with
us i think for the fourth seven or eight
year at this point too and that's always
amazing to me um let's see
uh forensic technology
one that's very big of course is just
the use of sheer data sorting right this
is probably the biggest one we're gonna
get to it's not that we're gonna get
better at spawning something like here's
one little dna strand and sphere tells
us who it was very quickly so we could
do a whole boom scan a few minutes and
know every last person been in there for
a while it's more that we're going to
have so many electronic and sensor
devices all over the place you know
they'll just in the background they're
gonna get very good at being able to
pick out those little telltales that let
us sort through
like right now you got someone's call
logs that's just something you have now
you know you never had that 50 years ago
we know everybody who calls somebody now
assuming they're not keeping that secret
in some fashion that's large that's easy
to pull and we know how long the phone
calls for just start their phone right
we know how long were who was et cetera
that's a big help now imagine you've got
all the photographs they've taken then
they had a gps location
um i don't know why photographs don't
have gps put on pretty much
automatically these days not that date
and time but figure that's coming soon
enough there's me so many bits of
information
just embedded all around people in their
their small house things like that that
you're going to be able to find so many
ways to just pick through that and just
find out what the motive means
opportunity forms that you probably want
okay for belshazzar could a civilization
make use of a neutron star
have we done i don't know if you've
actually done an episode on neutron
stars specifically we did an episode on
dying stars um
civilizations in time dying stars so i
think that was more of a look at how to
fix ours was getting older
and also how to do white dwarfs yeah
neutron stars are very useful you can
basically you can just hammer to them
together to make a black hole which is
useful or make a
awful lot of heavy elements like gold
and platinum
but it's not like the most efficient way
he said what would we do with a neutron
star i don't think a civilization would
ever be too inclined to actually let
one's form naturally but
i think what would be handy about a
neutron star just in general is that you
can do a lot of transmutation nearby it
wherever you have an awful lot of
gravity potentially setting a particle
beam around it in a tight orbit and that
can be used in much same way a super
clutter can then we do this a black hole
too to reduce some really impressive
alchemy that's a actually the topic for
episode nuclear transmutation that i
think is coming up
the last week of february or the first
week of march one of the two
all right well john dahlberg says hey
isaac i've heard you talk about the
potential for huge populations in the
future
can you discuss how that type of growth
could play out in developed countries
with low birth rates currently
i think the biggest thing here is that
we should keep in mind that the
population growth of any given
region and and we're going to be careful
in the same country here because
population growth around the country is
not a static thing you know what is new
york city is not what is in la or
chicago let alone what it is in a rural
area or suburban area right these are
not the same and they should not be
compared
we have as it's something that's one of
my notorious button issues
we have an awful lot of very
um
careless discussion of how population
growth or or decline
takes place there's almost always framed
in the context of
looking at a specific country's overall
total population birth rate
or immigration or population and drawing
wild you know analogies off that and say
well what was it 20 years ago you're
seeing what's going to be in 20 years
what was it 20 years ago
um another one was one time i pulled all
the data from the 10 richest countries
and i said well the 10 richest countries
if if wealth and development are going
to be what controls population growth
presumably should be your 10 least uh
growing nations once the lowest birth
rates and that particular year there
wasn't a single match
you know that one of the 10 lowest
growing population places was also one
of the 10 wealthiest nations gdp wise
per capita and that tells me that there
was you know less correlation than
random odds
so i think there's a narrative people
have about the population rate declining
that in many cases is looking at
countries that are developed well these
are countries that are already very full
of people right population growth rates
are always a little bit slow in cities
too highly urbanized data is not going
to grow as fast a lot of this has to do
with people having developed uh better
birth control technologies but
call to appreciations for wanting to
actually have uh you know not get
pregnant as soon as you're 18. right not
start a family that early these things
themselves do not represent
eternal trends that you can just push
out to infinity
and they're often treated that way so a
question that comes up all the time this
channel is why do you think in the
future we're going to need lots more
plants lots more habitats room for
trillions of trillions of people when
the population
uh is declining and you say well it's
not it's it's not declining at all it
was six billion uh and a little bit of
change in 2000 it's gonna hit eight
billion a couple more years and it was
like two billion sell the previous
century show me one year off the global
plant has actually had the population
decline i'd be surprised in the last few
centuries
and uh i assume that that probably is
more indicative of why we always say
this is anything like cycles of history
people talk about inevitability of
things happening over and over again
wheels are not natural we made them it
was a thing that we invented uh they
spin around over and over again to move
something from point a to point b or to
engage in some intentionally cyclic
pattern then they stop moving they don't
have a reason why they move like that
things in history or behaviors about
people trends and traditions have things
driving them and we don't want to look
at just the data and say well based on
this curve this is what's going to
happen
ask instead which is how we do science
why is it doing this specific thing
and i think that's coming very important
for a lot of people when they're trying
to predict these things because so often
with the population trend data just for
over a century now almost my prediction
has been hopefully wrong and i'm not
giving you a picture of what it's going
to be because i'll be wrong too if you
don't know why it's going to be these
things mining that's gonna be different
in every region of the planet based on
culture based on something as small as
what the most popular new movie was that
year like sword that green comes out it
makes a little bit noise about starting
a family you know
these things are not easily predictable
and they you go by what causes people to
do something but i would usually say as
a whole
species are designed to reproduce more
than they need to survive with
free technology so i don't really see
them declining your number as long as
they can comfortably glow that's where
you get that basic concept from and
that's why i tend to assume the
population will keep growing as long as
we comfortably can do so
we have another web fan that says hi
isaac from us in very cold amsterdam new
york just to say thanks for all the
videos you upload we love sci-fi physics
and astronomy and your videos and
narrative are superior to anything on tv
thank you
for that
it is
yeah appreciated
thank you
and then we have a question from tim and
yo hi how would you attack a mckendree
cylinder
uh for context and i think we'll try to
get this one up quick and one more
before we go to the break uh mckendree
cylinders are like onions on those
they're gigantic orbiting habitats
except that they are what we call
continent class one whereas like oh neo
sunos come in island three designs
things that might be the size of a large
town or maybe a small county uh a
mckendree cylinder is
the size of a continent right it might
be a medium-sized country to as big as a
plant depending how you build it in
terms of its living area
and it might have multiple levels that's
the main difference there the way you
attack one would probably be to cut off
its actual external power supply if it
was getting it from like the sun and
it's not getting from the sun then you
would probably be to
try to
make sure it can't get out of its heat
because most of those things are
probably going to be producing more heat
if they're not getting sunlight in then
they can actually radiate away just from
the cylinder itself so bouncing energy
in these things you know obviously their
sense of just being blown up but i think
if you're not trying to just blow the
thing up uh and kill billions of people
in one shot your way of doing that would
just be to kind of reflect energy back
in onto it so that was not cooling so
just kind of turned the thermostat up on
everybody very slowly until they got
uncomfortable and
surrendered you don't ever want to
actually send infantry forces in a kind
of a modern sense into any sort of
rotating habitat that is
a pair of horrible bottlenecks you'll
get decimated it is not an invasion
friendly environment
lundgard says back in 2017 you made a
video about usable rockets with all of
the new advances in the field are you
going to do something like an update in
your video um
maybe yeah a lot of times i try to stay
away from whatever's coming out this
year uh part of that is because there
were there are a lot of other people who
do great videos on those and faster too
i write an episode and it's about three
months for whatever actually shows up on
the screen you know there are exceptions
we've done like tributes when somebody
passed on we got out like the next day
uh it was a case like dyson
um when freeman dyson passed away last
year but uh in most cases we have a few
amounts of time to develop them i take
my time see what the developments are
um whereas we have a lot of folks who
are very fast about turning around and
they can do just as good look because
there isn't a lot to speculate about
they are they're detailing how this
particular piece of technology
specifically is going to do stuff um
so i don't really mind doing something
like an update on reusable rockets but i
nothing that we've had already happened
recently striker is requiring an update
this time
let's go ahead and go to uh our break
and we'll back in formats we'll see you
then so we have a quick break for a few
minutes and it's a great time to get
more questions into our moderators for
part two we always run out of time for
questions but we try to get to as many
as possible and roughly in the order
asked and i try to answer those left
afterwards in the show's comments
one from last month was isaac if you
were given the task of choosing a first
contact team what specialties would be
on your list and why
and it's a great question because we
often see this in science fiction and a
lot of times the answers aren't really
very logical even down to including a
linguist who is an expert at human
communication and who might be less
useful than a biologist or mathematician
for generic usefulness at figuring out
what the aliens use for communicating
and the basic patterns
a lawyer or a politician or police
officer or professional criminal
interrogator would be tempting to
include too because i want someone used
to detecting deceitful behavior and also
good dodging questions
this would probably be my picks by
default if i had to though that's not
how i would run a forced contact or
expect it to occur
first and foremost it depends on the
nature of that contact because a setting
message we receive is very different
than us encountering another ship in
deep space moving at some fraction of
light speed a few light days away from
our own ship doing the same
both are much more likely than the usual
sci-fi image of us encountering a ship
and parking next to them to relay
healing messages while close enough to
exchange gunfire which is a bad idea
simply because the quick communication
in close range add urgency and worry to
the exchanges that isn't necessary
making a nervous situation all the more
volatile
trading messages at email or snail mail
speeds is better than phone call speeds
let alone one actually in person which
should only plausibly ever happen if
making force contact with a civilization
that has no radio or high technology
now for sending a team over to the ship
and as a first contact scenario this
just seems insane unless we're talking
about a forced contact contingency plan
for some team set to explore alien ruins
we believe are empty and the team has a
first contact protocol rehearsed against
the eventuality they get cut off from
communication and encounter aliens
which is decently likely since that
implies either alien life was pretty
well hidden from scans and thus in areas
with bad signals perhaps or has ambushed
you to get some answers about why you're
in their territory
if you know they were there then your
first contact team shouldn't be anybody
you value if they're technological they
probably have brain scanners and an
unhealthy interest in disassembling life
forms to see what makes them tick and
you're gambling on their ethics being
somewhat decently analogous to our own
if you lose then they have your crew
members to analyze and there is actually
a good chance you are consigning them to
repeated resurrection and torment while
they take their brain data and
recordings and scans and use that to
rebuild them biologically or digitally
over and over to use as potentially
frame jack test subjects of behavior a
few days of virtually simulated
existence sped up a million fold and
running with thousands of copies in
parallel might be dissecting those
explorers over and over while running
them through every scenario they can
imagine to learn about human behavior
all the while designing weapons against
our dna and technology and psychology
this incidentally doesn't even imply
they are hostile the aliens might simply
consider that a common sense approach
and your crew might be returned to you
unaware this was done to them and is
still being done to their copies
so you send a relatively simple robot
and remote control it that's your first
contact crew a nice sterile robot with
basic tech and no genetic samples or
brains to read no bombs on board or
suicide devices because they might
detect that and viewed as hostile you
send me a bomb to their ship then your
real crew is far away able to discuss
answers among many fields and able to
incinerate their own ship down to the
atoms if the aliens attempted to board
them instead of politely asking
questions and giving answers
and now back to the show and answers to
more of your questions
[Music]
alright and we're back as a quick
reminder phone as we get into uh part
two here uh we are also trying to
collect episode suggestions for poor to
be on after the episode uh for
continuing the outward bound series
episodes like colonizing pluto mercury
etcetera though not ones we haven't done
before only once we haven't done before
also we're going to try to move a little
bit faster through questions here in
part two so
i always remind you that we get a lot of
questions in at the beginning and then
it's hard to uh get the answers out so
going back to isaac burdow he says i
hope you guys are having a good day do
you have any thoughts on spacex's plan
to catch starships
at starships
uh i i didn't catch that one every so
often it's surprising there's a lot of
bits of news on space i i tend not to
miss uh this week i've been a little bit
distracted uh we had a friend recently
for my old youtube passed away sean
french who also
uh like post leader in fighting cancer
for years now and he actually uh
you know unfortunately did lose his
battle with that uh uh last week
uh sean i saw together in iraq and he's
a really good guy so
um just you know hopefully his his
family could be uh abstract doing that
so uh also uh we were going flying which
is slightly more exciting i suppose uh
we've got our own plan to catch
starships
and uh it was curious actually i posted
on my personal facebook page which is
public um but uh
i posted like a bridge version that and
it was my first time actually flying
myself actually you know controlling it
and uh scary experience if you're not
used to it um and this actually only my
second time on airplanes kind of how the
military uh well over a decade ago so uh
it was a little windy yesterday it was
really it was very when the hour class
was uh you don't
know anything about only doing the
safest bit of it but uh it is
definitely experience to catch up on my
wife is a much better path than me
already i've only flown twice yeah it's
not at least put a flat away i think so
too
so she's definitely about a pilot there
well didn't one of your fans say you
needed the hands of a woman to fly well
yeah but i i found that's usually
speaking i got the big mitts so you know
let's get to the questions yes well we
have a super chat thank you tkg from
wildfire
and he says the a lagrange wheel is when
six similarly sized objects are 60
degrees around an orbital path locking
each of them by the l3 l4 and l5
lagrange points what would be the
implementation of this concept into the
future okay well
usually everything more like a kepler
was that which doesn't actually have to
have just six members um any two objects
are going to produce an l4 and l 5.6
degrees forward and back of them on the
orbital path of the larger one with a
very disproportionate you can also put
any number of objects either around one
object or just around each other as big
circle
uh like you could have
a hundred or size plants all orbiting
nothing at all you know put a sun in the
middle but they would actually still
already there wasn't a sun there though
slower uh just as a bigger ring
i think you'll be seeing an awful lot of
variations on that that have to do with
obviously the fact that you
never really get to have control over
your exact situation with gravity and
area of interest because usually this
big massive object there i think that
that will be one of the many examples of
open mechanics we have to try to take
advantage of because we're kind of
forced to a little bit like the l2 or
halo thing that we've got going on the
james webb uh
orbits around nothing at all at the l2
point because the l2 is not actually
stable
okay
bobo master how large could the
population of an intergalactic
civilization with metastructures b in
the goggles
in the
googles
googles
i suppose it's not spelled that way but
it could be
um
how big can a k3 civilization be in
terms of population
i suppose if we were talking about a uh
if it was running at the land our limit
i think we said you could get uh and
there's what he had to say
six freeze calm or something like that
you could probably get away with running
somewhere north of
10 to the 42 people simultaneously but
it depends on how quickly you're running
them um you are welcome to go ahead and
do the math on what 10 to 42 is a
million trillion trillion trillion i
think the grain of salt uh just run
through the calculations we looked at
back in the
civilizations the entire the original
episode actually uh black hole farming
and then just you know take the actual
lunacy the galaxy i suppose for that
that should be about your right answer
as opposed to the luminosity both sun or
spin hockey radiation black hole
okay
and
u92 element says so what do you think
can be done about kessler
syndrome
we have an episode on that coming up um
in what um
i just got proved so be
okay february 10th and february 13th are
episodes on kessler syndrome and on
other things called that could imprison
planets so we will we will bypass that
for now but you have a lot of options uh
everything from nuking orbits which is
not before but could work in some cases
uh to laser booms we'll discuss this a
bit more in an episode so tune in 9am
thursday morning
to
isaac's youtube channel yes
all right here's another one uh people
have been asking us to kind of put
things on more mediums and for the
longest time basically i put the audio
only versions for free up on soundcloud
and i put the video here
and um you know we shared the links to
the place and said you can get it either
location but as we were down things like
nebula we put on itunes spotify uh it's
on
amazon music it's on animal these the
audio inversions and we have also gotten
around that request to putting over on
rumble which is a youtube alternative
that's been getting kind of popular in
more recent years
and uh for the moment because that one
was very easy to start uploading but
apparently it would take about a month
to finish uploading all more videos
because there's like
one every other hour so you can also
find us now there
uh this person said has a tagline this
is new hi isaac and sarah could copper
be a bottleneck element for intelligent
life expansion
being the only good conductor at the
temperature range where water is liquid
and all earth life needs liquid water
i don't know if i'd say that i mean
circles a magnificent conductor and it's
not as common as as copper obviously but
uh
um there are a lot of other things you
can serve as as conductors this decent
one but
as a fair point you know we talked about
phosphorus scarcity um
a year or two ago for the former paradox
that's a very popular one because your
life depends on that but there are a lot
of elements that could
limit a civilization to expanding um you
know uh
it might not be as causative things some
are going to be really common you're not
going to find plants don't have silicon
on them or aluminum though those are
limitations you might find in underwater
civilization there's no way to make use
of them
um but yeah carpal could be scarce
enough in some circumstances that you
really can do very good wiring so they
don't really get you know too much
electricity going on but i feel like
that would just be a delay
you know
i don't really like the malthusian
approach of doomsday of saying
civilizations only have so much time to
get into space before they die we have
to remember we talk about things like
counter clocks on civilizations because
if they don't get done by this period of
time they'll have used up this resource
fossil fuels or you know wreck the
atmosphere or elect the environment uh
we have to keep in mind that those are
usually assumptions of a very high tech
civilization like our own beating up
their planet in some fashion will be up
each other if you actually don't have
those technologies in play because
you're taking you're getting slowed down
developing them like because your cop is
very short and waiting to develop
something cheaper and better yourselves
those really shouldn't have the counter
clock honestly more than
when we discovered pottery that kind of
thing
tim and yo want to know if ice could be
used as a building material in the outer
solar system
yes um
there's a lot of talk about using pie
creates which is basically ice with
fibrous material in it
um ice is already used to building
material or at least
uh in the same way that mud brick is
used for instance is is we have to work
with it you work with what you got in
the environment and one thing i like
about ice is you can experiment a lot
with it here on earth
a problem though is that ice is
you know there is no liquid in space
there are a few substances that can be
liquid-ish in a vacuum but by and large
things supplement directly so you add a
layer of almost any ice structure in
space you're going to need to cover that
over like a layer of foil
to prevent it
uh subliminating that off and just
having the ice boil away into space and
lose it
but other than that ice is one of those
things that it's not just a question or
is it useful to work with it's more of a
question of
uh how do you find other ways to make it
useful to work with is going to want to
use it there's so much going to be
available
okay thank you merv johnson for your
super chat welcome back how well could a
cylinder habitat be converted to a bowl
if it was flown to and embedded in a
body with existing gravity such as unity
to the moon
um the point that we sometimes make is
that if you wanted to add gravity on a
place like the moon or mars where left
gravity is pretty low
you can combine rotating gravity with um
with normal gravity but the problem is
that you need to do is kind of a wide
bowl people sometimes getting precious
very shallow
bowl in practice it's going to be more
like that a very tight or unlike thing
like a face
um
and at that point we're going to
reconfigure the floor a little bit i
think you could go wider but more likely
to do a couple of tiered levels of
flooring and so it would look like a
rotating habitat picture 101 only the
downside
uh
well the downsides as to which direction
the actual planet is his skin got a
little bit skinnier towards the bottom
uh there's a number of shapes that might
be a little bit more convenient towards
the circle but you probably are doing
kind of a teal garden thing on the way
down
okay
roflcopterkerman how bright would the
night sky be in a k3 civilization galaxy
with all the nav lights drive plumes and
propellant outgassing would it be more
luminous than our natural one
um that is a good question i think it's
hard to answer that one by the way the
last one the question was how hard would
we reconfigure those now i think about
and the answer is not very hard at all
it not easy but not too hard to
reconfigure a similar to your planet
um
especially a low gravity one um let's
see k3 civilizations you might like if
you have a civilization that runs on
black hole starship drives you know the
google blitz black hole ones those
should be detectable to us via seti type
efforts right now but they are on the
gamma range not gonna see that as much
um
alternatively you know
if you have thousands of ships coming
and going from a planet every day which
is not indicative of really all that
much space traffic to be honest you're
gonna constantly be seeing something up
in the sky looking like a meteor there's
only a lot of noise pollution you can
see the iss with you know you can see it
pretty clearly with the pair of
binoculars uh but it's visible
satellites are often visible moving to
the sky to just our eyes
now imagine you had a troll you know
that would open up a planet and so well
that's a lot um or even just a billion
or maybe just a million it's a very
bright sky at that point
um
i think you'd probably have to have a
lot of
limitations on how how much light
pollution you got um there are ways to
kind of counteract that but a lot of
times you'll be saying well shift your
you know shift your production into
things that are not visible naked eye or
you might just tell people hey this is
this is the price of living in the inno
system go out to the outer system and go
live inside this great big collection of
cylinder habitats that have a opaque
shell built around them so they're all
options but
likely it will be bright yeah probably
very vibe
red coney isaac i'm a huge fan glad to
be on the live stream and it's been a
while for me my question is why do you
believe that interstellar travel at
relativistic speeds to travel the galaxy
is possible or impossible
um
well it's in terms of it being possible
i never think you'd actually have much
traveling at like 99 of life speed i
think you almost always have stuff that
was moving that's more like at most half
but
even one percent of life speeds very
hard to do even with fission drives even
with the fusion drive it can be tricky
too you know usually we talk about a
fusion base drive um
our assumption is that we got basically
the fusion going on blowing out the back
in practice a fusion power drive or
fission power drive is often just
basically an ion drive which isn't
really going to be all that much more
impressive than we have now which can
just keep pushing until it runs out of
fuel but it might only get you up to you
know 0.1 c
um but the laser pushing option we talk
about a lot that is high energy
something like the lasers but you got it
you know and and
you have all that energy boost stuff
back and forth with so you probably
would see spaceships taking advantage of
that
okay so a question from smiley face do
you think there could be beans that live
in wormholes or black holes like in the
expanse and interstellar no
i hope not think about those giants
in physics there are some
there are certain scenarios of like
multiverse concepts where the laws
physics are a bit different that you
would have things like that happening
yeah even life forms built out of black
holes but not not realistically inside
our universe and all constraints
okay
gurchen easnick hello from the
netherlands you've changed my life and
given me hope for humanity and even
purpose to my life
thank you
i appreciate that
okay question now from sano bello have
you ever come across a faster than light
method that accounts for causality
breaking other than one in the house of
sons
i like the one for the house of sons
they basically just had set up so your
wormhole between two places snip those
two bits out from reality for the
purpose of causality uh in terms you
couldn't see what was going on there
they are they they the andromeda galaxy
basically disappeared millions of years
before and uh i'm not gonna spur that
book because you should absolutely go
read it it's it's his best novel in my
opinion alistair reynolds uh i love his
series revelation space but standalone
books go
i love that novel it's it's probably the
best science fiction i was ever written
um
and uh
yeah
that's
i can't but the question was no not
beyond things like that
shawn ainsworth thank you for all your
work the episodes and all the work i
have watched all of them and re-watch
anytime when i have not much to do also
a big thanks to your lovely wife oh
that's me thank you and all the people
that have helped you cendrian etc
there are a lot of them um
there are i mean when i said there's
like 100 people on the crew there are
folks who will leave for like a year or
so and only pop by to hit a little
message on on one script there are the
folks who devote hours to it like every
week um and
it varies just you know because again
i'd like people to only involve
themselves in their spare time and where
they're interested but that group of
people has over the years been
told me invaluable doesn't even cover
enough the show would probably not be
around anymore if i didn't have all
those other people there to
help stimulate the brain waves
speaking of which we had a question a
little earlier from nick marco about
what attracted you to make sci-fi videos
um
last night we had occasion to use
facebook watch for the first time as an
app and i got mine of an old old video i
did before i was even on the board of
elections that was
an incredibly slow walkthrough
of every single ballot issue that was on
the ballot of my area just not in favor
just telling people what it was like how
much this levy would cost them et cetera
and uh i was reminded when i saw that
that actually predates the show and a
lot of times i will say because we are
going to rewrite history a little bit to
ourselves that there were no videos um
you know the first video's mega
structure was back in september 2014 but
i actually done quite a few random
videos on this or that kind of topic
before there was ever a channel or
thought of it
the first video that's still up on the
show i delete all those to kind of clear
the genre out because it came the
futurism sharing out isaac's random
posting page uh that was because it
wasn't anything special about it i was
just like i want to try a couple new
techniques
um
like powerpoint and video production and
i spent a lot of time in a world
building forum on facebook
and i constantly come up so i have to
have to explain certain kind of major
structures to folks because i was a
little bit of a mild crusade of beating
the dead horse about trying to get
sci-fi fighters not spend all their time
on planets you're not the planetary
chauvinism of one little colony on one
planet as opposed to all these cool
megastructures like the oniosando and so
i decided to do a video that highlighted
them all and had all the beautiful
artwork for folks like steve bowers and
others from orion's own and that's it
there wasn't supposed to be anything
special about that it wasn't meant to be
an episode it wasn't meant to be a
channel and uh
i just i always like to put information
out i guess
welcome back simon farmer thank you for
your super chat he says if the first
rule of warfare
is to be the first to act in a combat
situation how important is the role of
autonomous ai and warfare
well the first rule of warfare is always
be proactive and make sure you strike
first uh not because of the other first
world warfare which is always to wait to
see what the other guy is going to do
and then react to that strategically
i think we had been dating about two
months when i finally asked you how many
first rules of warfare there were
the second world war as i occasionally
tell people i forgot about for years but
it was the only time i ever heard one of
my sergeants uh in the military say uh
something and say that wasn't the most
important thing but like you know the
second most important thing and it was
to always have uh in your backpack a
little ziploc bag with a pair of dry
socks and a spare paper underwear so i
officially have the second rule of
warfare is always have dry socks you
know uh
always keep spare socks around that is
actually a really good idea though is
always keep like a t-shirt and socks in
a ziploc bag and like your rucksack or
your trunk etc
um for those rainy days when you really
really really are just eat something
change into
um
let's see
autonomous warfare and ai or so thomas
ai and warfare what's the impact of that
he's i'm trying to actually answer the
questions faster but i really don't do
that
um let's see
i mean obviously it's going to be a
really huge impact overall in terms of
how we let drones do this but in the
short term
we're not going to get
you know
i think there's probably gonna be a
treat if there's already but a feeling
that
uh drones should not be allowed to
actually have the decision to file the
actual decision to
uh taking action that might kill a human
should always have to actually have a
human on the end of the switch i think
that's probably the rule for quite some
time with things like drones so that's
my best guess in general terms
okay smiley face says do you think a
type 3 civilization would have a
political divide amongst its population
i think a type 3 civilization would not
have any sort of political unity in
general if you don't have fascinate
travel uh you're not gonna have anything
like approaching homogeneous
civilization except maybe
maybe in a post stellar universe when
everyone's got their brains slowed down
to run it like uh
you know micro kelvin temperatures and
so everything's basically slowed down to
that digital
land hour limit speed where you know for
them
light really is traveling in the course
of a minute across the entire galaxy
because you know it was just going so
slow other than that i just can't
imagine how you'd ever had that without
ftl and even with ftl
i don't expect to see me populated dyson
systems that had ones you know culture
of two civilizations that had just one
one government um
usually what binds people together to
actually have a unified government is
either a
that government is offering them really
superior services all the perception of
them in all these cases what people
think is the case is as important as
what really is or they're offering them
shared defense from an external threat
um
in the absence that people generally are
probably going to want to split up more
and i don't really think you'd have too
many cases even though dyson sphere was
actually a single unified quality in
favor of something more like you know
millions of them but they might just
have different tiers or levels it's
going to vary all across the galaxy i'm
sure i just can't imagine a single
unified k3
even with ftl
so dara
cloak thank you for your super chat
hello isaac do you believe that there
are planets with eucardic life within
one thousand light years of our solar
system your chaotic life
um
uh
you know this is uh this is a source of
both agreement and disagreement
simultaneously with myself and john
michael godier um if you haven't seen
his show by the way event horizon um one
of his more common guess
john is awesome but he's strongly an
opinion that probably your strongest
fermi paradox filter is your chaotic
life or your chaotic life uh cells with
nuclei in them um developing the first
place
uh i think that's a potentially very
strong filter i'm not sure it's as
strong
as some of the other options but in
terms of a great photo it's a good one i
don't expect to find any a complicated
life inside a thousand light years of us
but i
i feel if your if it evolves reasonably
commonly expect to find it within a
hundred light years if not then not so
if that is the great filter then not
within a thousand light years of us
all right so twist says do you think
that the earth is part of another alien
civilization's territory
potentially uh you know a lot of times
we're asking context like this um how
big of a space are we talking about with
an alien civilization we could be some
tiger closet you know um
all the colonizable terraforming will
plant solar system number about a
trillion besides galaxy not about a
trillion in that zone right if you take
a trillionth of earth surface area which
is 510
square kilometers or 510 trillion square
kilometers you'd have
square roots you'd have 510 square
meters that would be what um
24 23 beetles on each side about about
size of half a football people
that's not a very big space for a planet
to be thought of and that's a whole
solar system mind you or planet not just
like the whole you know just a little
bit like a little zoo the size of
football field
so it's very easy to believe that
suicide hold plants like oh it's just be
left alone
however um you know in their galactic
empire as well
however i really can't imagine that we
would be under somebody's protective
shadow without knowing about it to be
honest at this stage there has been a
point we expect to tell them and we're
at that point of diminishing returns
whereas like why would you not at this
point let us know you know if you ask
people on pole over half the population
already thinks they're aliens
often visiting regularly um so i don't
think they're going to get much by
waiting longer and then the other bit is
how big of an area we're talking about
for their empire because
we usually are saying oh some stellar
galactic empire which is a very big
difference but what about a multiversal
empire you know not just something like
this local supercluster of billions of
galaxies but the whole absorbable
universal even one that contains
several trillion different universes
that they all control and rule that may
be created you know those are options
you have to kind of think about it so
i'll talk about territory and then we'll
see answer is i have no idea i don't
think we are though i don't think we are
part of anybody's empire
so raven609 wants to know why aliens
don't wear clothes
yeah this one actually might be kind of
fair um
i don't you know the usual soldiers that
humans slowly lost our hair from long
time wearing clothes to adapt to other
environments but there's a lot of guest
work on that and that's that's what it
was last i paid attention to that was
probably at least a decade ago so that
might be not the theory anymore
um
but aliens are usually not demonstrated
with hair either they're usually
portrayed as naked and hairless yeah
i would say usually the biggest biggest
thing they have going on then diet i
think the asgard and stahlgate they
actually have colonel o'neill point out
that they're all naked um but you'd
expect them to probably be wearing like
a utility belt at least just because so
nicely to carry stuff with you
um i really wouldn't expect to see naked
aliens unless they had like built-in
pouches like a kangaroo and actually
if you know much about kangaroos pouch
or possums pouch that's not really a
place you want to be putting anything
you want to keep clean either so i kind
of assume everything is going to be
carrying stuff around whether or not
they'd actually have clothes for
modesty's sake i don't know it depends
on their planet
but you could easily have like
almost all of all land masses liveable
is in the northern hemisphere of this
planet by coincidence though you got the
antarctica is completely unlivable you
could easily have a distribution on a
planet where pretty much everything was
in it reasonably tempo itself and
clothes were just not a thing um but i
think you probably see a lot of aliens
with clothes from general i would guess
all right let's take two more questions
and then call it quit something can we
do three three three all right
um rom dan wants to know if you would
ever make an episode about craft worlds
like the ones that the eldars use sure
um
in the kind of the 40k setting i don't
know if we actually get too many really
good descriptions of those the only one
i actually remember is from one of the
uh fabulous bio books for the invading
one um but uh
i we could probably do one on artificial
plants there were also spaceships yeah
that was not like planet ships but just
kind of more of a big one with
artificial gravity yeah maybe
okay ours thought great uh thank you for
your super chat do you think that tipler
oracles and basement universe are
possible
we probably will not get a chance to do
a typical cylinders episode i really
would like to run on a mega point
typically had a lot of interesting ideas
the controversial ones and me them
probably not very well based but uh we
might want to go visit that some more in
the future
um
then you have a basement or attic
universe
that is not something i can answer in as
much time as we have right now but that
actually does sound like a potentially
cool episode so i'll put that on my
maybe list as a uh as a
um consolation popular to answer that in
the meantime we have
okay last question for today
dean lawson hey isaac what are your
thoughts on the simulation hypothesis
that claims our universe and reality are
actually running on some massive
computer system somewhere that's right
back that same question um total is all
the way down uh computers all the way up
we have done episodes on the simulation
hypothesis
my usual one on that again over and over
is it's not a question of whether or not
you live in a simulation that's not the
question right the question is does it
matter we already have an awful lot of
human belief that center around the idea
that there was a higher plane to
existence right this is not a new idea
it's one that we see in
pretty much every religion i can think
of honestly um
if you're an anthropologist you don't
need to might be talking about the
exceptions that that's just indicative
that i don't know too many of them
um you know whether it's the okay like
mid-garden versus other places in
northeast mythology obviously christian
engineering christian and there's uh
islamic or buddhist mythology you see a
lot of upper layers to reality and
little underwater layers aren't always
meant to be physically on the same plane
of existence
um
i don't think that's an idea that people
have too much problems saying oh but i
don't live in that reality above so i'm
not real
that's that's kind of problem there in a
simulation where we basically are saying
it's being done on a computer you're not
real because you're on a computer as
opposed to just done somewhere created
lower level of resistance by
supernatural power
the other thing remember is
what functions in our reality only if
it's a simulated
ancestor force where you're trying to
simply make a universe identical to your
own in many factors would you even have
the same kind of physical rules to allow
things like computation so you can't
make too many assumptions about what a
higher level would be like or what the
under levels are like
um for instance you can actually have a
more populated lower level
um
just by running it slower or giving you
more memory if that substantive level
below it and so on there's a lot you
could do with that but uh that is
another topic for another also when
we've done some episodes on uh see our
episode simulation and uh
purpose simulation reality
uh virtual awards uh fully paradox
consideration hypothesis and probably a
couple of those too
speaking of which before we let you go

thank you for your super chat and he
says hi isaac i've been watching you
almost every day for the past five years
and i just wanted to say thanks for what

joining just before we close out uh
you've already seen the episodes that
are coming out pretty soon uh i think i
already um mentioned though as we said
we're going to be doing a poll i'll try
to get up the next 10 minutes or so over
on our community tab we're just going to
go ahead and get a list of all the
various things people been suggesting
during the chat
as potential colonizing episodes you
know for the outward bound series and
we'll put those up in a poll as soon as
i can hopefully next 10 minutes so after
i close out the stream you still have
time to submit them though since i
haven't seen those lists again thank you
everyone so much for joining us today
and i think i got all of our
announcements so we will see you on
thursday and also of course next month

and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook reddit
discord or our website isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
thursday
