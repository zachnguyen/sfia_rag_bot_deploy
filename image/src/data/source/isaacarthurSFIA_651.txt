Welcome! Ð¢his channel focuses on in-depth looks at science and futurism.
We explore concepts like the Fermi paradox, exoplanets, terraforming alien planets or blowing them up.
Giant megastructures too big to even fit
on a planet
and ideas like mind uploading and simulated realities
or living around black holes in the distant
future, interstellar colonization,
arcologies and planet wide cities. Alien
civilizations and artificial planets are
just some of the many topics we look at
here.
So if those sound interesting to you
