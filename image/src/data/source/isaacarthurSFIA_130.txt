Starboosting is a technique for raising the
surface temperature of stars to create larger
habitable regions around them, and under sunlight
more like our own sun produces.
The vast majority of stars are red dwarfs,
ultra-long-lived but cool stars with a redder
spectrum of light than our Sun, similar to
what a ‘warm’ color light bulb gives off.
Virtually all planetary systems have all the
planets in a fairly narrow range of orbits
around that star’s equator, meaning none
of the starlight of its polar region hits
a planet.
But by floating large, thin statite mirrors
above the poles we can reflect light back
down onto the star, warming it, and causing
it to emit more light and in a hotter spectrum
toward those planets.
Such mirrors float by radiant pressure above
the star, and likely would require only a
few larger asteroids worth of mass to build,
and could also work as massive power collectors
and a Shkadov drive for moving that star system.
See the Megastructure Compendium for more
discussion of stellar engines and megastructures.
