Terraforming barren planets like Mars or creating
rotating space habitats like the O’Neill
cylinder require vast amounts of water, and
comets and other icy bodies are common suggested
sources.
But it would take a million such comets to
bring decent oceans to a single planet, and
when you want to build toward Kardashev 2
civilizations, you need many thousands if
not millions of times the water Earth has.
But water is hydrogen and oxygen, the first
and third most common elements in the Universe.
Most rocky planets have more oxygen than any
other element, but hydrogen tends to be in
scant supply in the inner solar system, and
needs to be lifted off a gas giant or a star,
at extreme energy cost.
But star’s can power the magnetic lifting
of elements off them with their own sunlight,
a process called starlifitng.
The sun also has more oxygen than the rest
of the solar system too, so we could not only
direct hydrogen from the sun to planets, but
recombine it with oxygen to make entire rivers
in space aimed to places that needed water.
