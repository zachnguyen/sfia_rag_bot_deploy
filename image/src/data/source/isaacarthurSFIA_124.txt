At the core of the Fermi Paradox is the question
of why we’re not seeing or hearing any alien
civilizations in a Universe vastly bigger
and older than our own planet, and a key concept
in discussing the Fermi paradox - one of our
most popular topics to cover - is that we
are never discussing civilizations like Earth,
but rather civilizations Earth could currently
see.
That’s always getting bigger as we get more
advanced but we could probably only see a
clone of our world within 100 to 1000 light
years.
Anyone beyond that range would be quiet to
us unless they engaged in much louder activity,
like building Dyson swarms or colonizing world
after world till they reached us.
Loud aliens leave a very detectable presence,
by being big, visible, and long lasting, they
are all three, in short: they are glaringly
obvious, and these don’t seem to exist,
at least currently, so most of the Fermi Paradox
discussions focus on Quiet Aliens, those that
may not be noticeable to us, or don’t last
long, or simply don’t exist..
