We often hear that our galaxy will collide
with the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest neighbor,
and that this will begin happening in a few
billions years, but this is not quite a correct
way of looking at things.
Indeed, one could make a case that Andromeda
and the Milky Way are merely part of a larger
galaxy and are simply condensing, as they
form a roughly dumbbell shaped collection
of stars with dozens of smaller galaxies in
and around them, all being drawn together
over the last 13 billion years, and finishing
over the next several billion.
The only other significant galaxy in the region
is Triangulum, and it will merge with us about
the same time, leaving a larger galaxy that
will eventually be isolated by Hubble expansion
from all the other merged galactic islands
in the expanding ocean of the night.
See our episode Intergalactic Voyages to learn
more about this process, intergalactic colonization
ahead of Hubble Expansion, and larger neighboring
galaxies like the Council of Giants.
