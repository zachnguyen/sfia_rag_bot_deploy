One approach to terraforming planets is to
begin inside large craters, crevices, tunnels,
or canyons where the existing landscape permits
you to fill an area with air without needing
as much delicate transparent materials to
protect it, and where any water would flow
back to if spilled.
Indeed even a layer or two of relatively thin
plastic sheets or tarps might work to hold
air inside.
A higher sheet, the canopy, protects against
wind, dust, and UV and is easy to replace
and depressurized, while a lower sheet, stretching
between rafter segments, possibly double-walled,
provides your pressurized barrier, allowing
fast, safe, and cheap para-terraforming of
large bases on new planets.
It is also very likely that many planets that
have no wind and rain will have canyons so
large and deep they could hold entire civilizations
and may need little coverage to hold air in,
while being resilient to damage from accident
or attack, as even large holes in their ceilings
would not quickly vent, and most buildings
inside would probably built with depressurization
in mind.

Domes of Mars and The Megastructure Compendium.
