good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia
monthly livestream q a we'll get started
in just a moment
but go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window so our
moderators can start relaying those to
me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink and a
snack
though we'll take a break about halfway
through too with all that said
welcome and let's get started
and welcome to our july 25th live stream
for science and futures with isaac
arthur i'm the aforementioned host isaac
arthur
and we joined today by my co-host my
lovely wife sarah fowler arthur who will
be asking his questions
and she has her eye glasses on today or
sunglasses on take she got stuck on the
face by b
which happened to be last week i am
sunburned so
we're just getting that out of the way
as we get questions in for the uh
audience to be asked and we will go
ahead and start off with one from last
month
yes our first question is from a t w w
a and thank you for the super chat your
question is are we even getting close to
understanding gravity
and dark matter um it depends on what
you mean by getting close to it these
days we tend to know what the effects
mostly are
of dark matter and dark energy but
when i was going to school there was
still a lot of debate about what dark
matter
was though it hasn't really changed that
much we've narrowed it down a bit more
but it was pretty much accepted and has
been probably for a couple decades
before that we was just
taking this given dog energy that was
just getting discovered we were just
starting to figure that out and
um 20 years later mostly what we made is
progress theoretical and a little bit
more conforming stuff to say the tapping
we've had a lot
of uh supernovas that are mostly we're
counting but we can only really refine
our data
for a lot of that by counting supernovas
and we can't reverse those
um at the same time because that's how
we measure the real distances
at the same time we really are no closer
to being able to say
what dark energy really is other than
maybe the space or the energy of space
time
and we also had a super chat from france
cadet and
thank you for that donation and he says
what is the right way to imagine the big
bang
um you know one of the popular examples
they like to do is
take a big bread thing of dough and
raisins in it and
you cook it and expands i've never
entirely liked that
but the basic notion of being big bang
is don't think of it as a big explosion
think of it as a very hot
gas that was inside a very tiny vessel
and the vessel itself is expanded
so the gas is a chance to kind of expand
and cool around
um that's the basic notions going on
there but the expansion that vessel that
is what your dark energy fundamentally
is is that energy
of space time it as
as time goes out space expands and
that's the energy of it we believe
loosely um and smiley fast face
smiley face says do you think the
expanse universe is more likely to be
what humanity will look like in the
future
uh the expanse uh for everyone who does
not know what that show is i still
haven't watched the last season that
came out but
uh i read the first few books and i've
seen the first few seasons
and they are more or less the same but
what we know about that setup usually
what people mean by that is
do you think that's how it's going to
rule out with earth having this
overpopulated
kind of mess on it and mars being a
rebel colony that's its own very
powerful government and the asteroid
mining belts are very
you know poor and dilapidated and
oppressed and full of terrorists and
pirates
and the answer is now um i don't doubt
people in the future will say
help help i'm oppressed uh but at the
same time
mars is never going to be the other big
power there's not 40k or the expanse
that's more likely to be the moon
or something that's going to be anybody
at all but the big other powers are
still going to be on earth
mars is never going to be a singular
powerhouse that i would guess
there's no reason for it to be you know
maybe venus and jupiter all the others
will be
big players in the game but both is
going to be your great big power and
everybody else is going to be
further down that list for eons to come
well at least thousands of years
here's one from today with the name as
long as the question
technological singularity with animal
gupta with the galactic
domination wants to know the galactic
laboratory will be the last episode of
the galactic
domination series will the galactic
laboratory be the last episode of the
galactic domination okay
um it's the last one that's actually
written at the moment
whenever i do a new series actually
called a series i always have at least
three videos in mind before i declare it
to be a series
uh character with the weaponizing
colonizing and um
oh you know what the other episode was
you've never seen black hole ships
colonizing black holes or weaponizing
black holes and that's all we've done
that series so it's just a trilogy but
until i have three tops of mine i won't
actually declare something in a series
usually before the first one comes out
i've written the first three episodes
too
i haven't decided what episode four will
be oh when it will come out
we have a list of topics that jerry
guerin and i had company suggested the
series to me uh kind of a
tongue-in-cheek thing why well
i mean i can't what the other video was
at the time but uh he gave me a whole
list of potential topics they thought of
i've had a few more i came up with and
those three though are the ones that we
can't start off with well um
the i think empire toner was the one i
came up with originally and then strip
mining galaxy and galactic laboratory
both his ideas
but those are written and the video for
galactic laboratory is
on my computer waiting to be released
next week so
that's the last one that's actually
written and planned this time though
kellen wong says is there any plausible
way besides fictional physics
virtual worlds and boarding raids that
would force us to go back to fighting at
closer ranges
both in planets and in space sure we
kicked around a few scenarios for
you know things that actually allow
melee combat for instance in our force
fields episode
way back uh i'd refuse that one to you
for some idea
but you know people say well in the
future you're never gonna have any
reason doing that close range stuff
and so that's what they said 100 years
ago um you know when we were getting the
point where
artillery and airplanes were just so
dominating the battlefield you couldn't
imagine why you'd have anyone rushing
forward with guns in the future
let alone up close and personal yet we
still do that the majority of combat
these days takes place at
you know a very short range uh i would
just mean like police
occupational forces in war zones etc um
high intensity warfare is all the
distance of you know very
high energies of war uh that's your
bombos or chili et cetera but
there's so many other things in the
future that can keep it close range but
the biggest one is
are you willing to just blow the heck
out of stuff and the answer is no if you
don't want to level that city or blow up
that space station
then you're going to have to get boots
on the ground even if they have robot
boots
and so then how you do that's mostly
gonna depend on the available technology
see the four strokes episode or the uh
planetary assaults episode for a little
discussion on that
exoplanet 2020 says how many people
could live in an o'neill cylinder before
too much waste heat makes it
uninhabitable
um depends entirely on how big
the uh the o'neill cylinder is like if
it's all the way upgrade to mckendree
sondel
usually on the show when i say mix uh
neo sondo i am thinking of the big
version not the mckendree but the
biggest of the ones that he discussed
which is uh
32 kilometers or 20 meter 20 miles long
and uh
uh eight miles in diameter i don't know
if i have that as in kilometers
but uh five could be five don't make
like 12. and that's either i'm getting
that one backwards whichever the case
that's like the size of a county
you know and if you want to double layer
that then you need to cut your lighting
down if you want to have two stacked
layers on there
because otherwise you're going to heat
up you know it's it's going to be
perpetually new
uh inside those if you have that much
heat going on all the time
you know if you cycling days and so
forth it's going to heat up if you want
to be earth-like
uh then you can only have one layer
before you have to start introducing
cooling systems
um but there's no actual limit on how
many people you put in one but kennedy
soda could have billions and that just
depends on your cooling technology and
how active you want to go with that
personally i don't think you really want
to do too many layers maybe at most a
dozen so
circulating back to traveling through
outer space
jacom heitmann says do you have any
interesting thoughts on the billionaire
space race
i'm glad that's going on um i mean
there really only all three of them
involved in that
richard branson elon musk and jeff bezos
and um there's
you know there are countries that are
still obsessed with this too it's like
it's just those three folks
they are both they are all three of them
folks who are very good
at i don't want to say the kind of
thomas edison and tesla approach of
being successful with their technology
as inventors or as promoters of
invention but also being very good at
talking to the public about building
enthusiasm for it so i think that that's
that skill is just having to kind of
coincide with them being billionaires of
some degree
but um i don't think it was a
billionaire space race i don't know if
people are trying to characterize it
that way i
don't think that's a good idea to kind
of do that
because it's going to make it seem like
bezos versus musk versus branson and
that is
you know this is not even spacex forces
blue origins etc
this is us trying to get out there
there's a team effort you know
and uh the space race had its advantages
back in the day
but right now we should be thinking this
is a relay race of a lot of people
working together to get done
not a competitive competition to see any
other than who gets the
biggest trophy as it will while
everybody gets to celebrate the end
a relay race is an interesting thought
the canadian wants to know how massive
something needs to be in order to hold
things on its surface
um that is
tricky we discussed that a little bit in
the micro black hole
that's why planetary cup in colonizing
black holes and in mega earth
we discussed how you calculate that a
little bit better for the miniaturized
ones
um there is no absolute maximum
but your key thing is the escape
velocity at the surface right
needs to be a order of magnitude higher
than whatever the surface temperatures
root mean square speed is
or you'll be gassing out constantly and
the escape velocity is actually
less than the root mean square speed of
all those warm air particles moving
around then
any puncture all the air is just gone
instantly but um
how you actually get that escape
velocity up to that level you can get
pretty condensed you could also you know
just put a glass shield around the plant
to keep it in there and go into a
relatively low microgravity setup too
so um there is no minimum size for what
you could actually hold things down with
gravity at
um that unless you want to get really
into where the gravitational cutoff is
for like
i need to have at least point zero one
percent gravity or something like that
but uh pretty small you can make a micro
plan around a black hole an artificial
black hole obviously
that is uh in the o'neill cylinder class
or smaller you know to that point of
being maybe even like a coplanar or
gateway
space station level of internal space
only a sphero
the k2 despot says hey isaac would you
ever consider doing a video
talking about the physics and possible
technological applications of
topolo topolo topological defect
phenomena
and magnetic monopoles and cosmic
strings
i am actually not a big
uh fan of magnetic menopause i know that
a lot of people feel they're very
critical to know i'll say the standard
model to a lot of the cosmological
models and
there's a good case for it but i i
really tend to feel like if you can't
find it in nature
i know someone's gonna point out the top
and bottom quark weren't found in nature
um but if you can't find them create
them etc if you can't figure out what
the stats are gonna be on them
if it starts getting really dubious we
should take it as a given there they are
cosmic strings which are kind of like a
mean probably the best analogy would be
a one-dimensional black hole instead of
point-like it's a long line
those i can't really see a case for
either i'm not sure why they wouldn't
collapse
you know um they might be funding an
episode on them at some point that means
a solid enough basic theory
so thank you winton ashley for your
super chat
and he wants to know if you think
negative friction could be a thing
i'm not sure what negative fiction would
be really probably the same thing as
negative cookies
yeah i guess probably so whenever you
start talking about negative quantities
you have to start thinking about which
particular quantity is going to negative
like um
terry pratchett author of discord had a
great example of this
in uh what he called anti-crimes he said
uh you know
the the the exact opposite quantity of
something has to be a little bit
different so
uh an anti-crime isn't uh a truly kind
across the board never act it's when you
still feel like a victim afterwards so
then someone's done something nice to
you so
breaking and decorating where you're
breaking into someone's house and redo
their place you've done a good deed by
them but they feel very violated by it
would be the opposite of breaking and
entering uh white mailing which is when
you
threaten a mob store by uh you know
threatening him to inform everybody of
his good deeds in secret
um thus ruining his reputation for being
a hard guy
um negative mass uh people say well what
would negative mass do well
negative mass you push on it should
actually push back you know it
should push back against you as well it
doesn't go flying because you have
negative rental towards you
um and uh so if you push it it goes
flying towards you
that doesn't really make sense though
does it right so it's
um negative friction friction slows you
down it's the
effect of ramming into infinite millions
of particles over and over and over
again that's slowing down
if you're running through a cloud of
negative matter presumably the exact
opposite should happen you should be
getting sped up
every collision every random collision
is somehow
assisting you to move faster uh
on paper that walks you your cylon
surface has an ice skater and you
accelerate just by being there
in practice that really doesn't make a
lot of sense so
maybe but that should be the fact as you
all across it would speed you up
joe flow says where do you think
manufacturing technologies are going
in the near and mid-term future
um i don't think they're converging
specifically so much as i think we're
going to see
two major areas i'd say that we'll
probably see a split up to one is going
to be that
um extreme standardization banging out
highly automated where it can just bang
the same product out over and over and
over again at the highest quality
really fast another is going to be the
things passed me
to change reader v2 fast there will be
the emphasis on how quickly can you
retool your factory
or your production line to produce a new
widget
with excellent production quality and
minimal time loss on teaching education
all that around that
what lets you switch over with me or to
produce one day soda cans the next day
shampoo bottles you know just because
there's something that's need for this
one new brand new shampoo bottle and
they need a million of them within the
next week
what lets you suddenly convert from
being able to do uh production
of um uh well to use covid last year and
the great toilet paper shortage what
allows you to vote for me able to do
production of paper
uh for a copy or two toilet paper what
lets you be able to switch over to
producing masks
from those just real quick and that's
probably going to be one of those big
areas that goes forward i know the
customers say more robots and more 3d
printing and
absolutely yes both of those things will
feature in there but always
not so much the method but what is the
main goal it's like
what the heavy 40s say if you ask people
what they want they'll tell you
they want a faster horse not a car
whether it's got more robots or 3d
printing what you're really looking for
is how do we produce these products
quickly and
quality with very little short notice or
how do we produce this one object we all
know we need
abundantly quickly
welcome back isaac for dough and he
wants to know if you have read the case
for space
by bob zubin uh yes um
near the case of mars uh before that i'm
having problems remembering what was in
the case of space though but
if you've not read uh rob zubin's book i
guess the one the case for most is
probably a little dated now though it's
still good read
another great book by him uh merchants
of despair great book
um he's a great writer and uh
i would highly recommend almost any of
his books to you but uh
that's a good one too your follower
it says yes that's the actual username
your follower
what would be some similarities and
differences between age of ocean
exploration
and age of space exploration
less pirates i don't know space pirates
might be a thing
well we had the space pirates episode a
few years back and i think
that was one of my favorite episodes to
do
um space pirates um
biggest thing with the age of sale is
once you're over the horizon no one
could see you and you know what's on the
other side
in space you're always going to know
where you know before you get there what
the destination looks like and not in
the
oh hey we can see you know 20 miles away
because
we have a very high mast on this ship
you're never going to know on an ocean
because of that whole what's coming up
in space you're always going to know
before you get there what you're looking
at you're just going to get to know it
better and better as you approach
now there's going to be some surprises
but when it talks about exploring that
whole sense of wonder being a close over
that one cliff or around that one bend
and so they go
a beautiful new vista that's not space
unfortunately but
that's the big difference between the
two the horizons
raven609 wants to know if you have any
thoughts on speculative
evolution i'm afraid i don't know what
the term means
okay then that would probably be a no
robo guy says
do you think religious aliens are
realistic or just a sci-fi trope
um i wouldn't see why you wouldn't
expect it i guess it kind of depends on
let's say again if you're assuming that
they like us in terms of that basic
cognition
concept then you would expect them to
have all the same traits that we had in
terms of philosophy
right they'd have differences but that
should be there and that's just one
example of that so
i would be very surprised if you did not
see that trade
thank you merv johnson for your super
chat today
and he says as a crowd-funded ai how is
your new
studio or lair it's a wonderful digital
uh universe that we have set up here now
i am loving it i'm going to skip on
trying to shoot the cameras around at
the moment because i i got them lined up
uh syndry alex long one of our producers
helped me do the lighting last time
around and
there's actually a map i used just for
those occasions uh for
two hours every month i actually set up
for a live video stream the rest of time
it is
my big desk uh bookshelves screens and
that's the way i like it quiet
he wants to know if it has missile silos
it does
yeah of course but don't tell
bryce hill what planet in our solar
system do you think is the worst to
colonize or mine for resources
i guess it would kind of depend on what
you mean by it depends so much on what
resource you want to get
and what your technology is if you're
talking like which one has the least
resources then it would be pluto
because pluto doesn't have much
resources although there are other dwarf
planets funny little dogs
yeah uh g pros got the most resources
but is the hardest one to actually
access
in terms of the planet well on the other
hand its moons are very readily
available
uh the plant that's probably gonna be
the most boring is probably going to be
uranus i think uh later neptune just
depends on which one turns out to be
slightly more valuable
c.r smith wants to know how your beard
looks so good
well i was going to say by carefully
dipping hydrogen peroxide a day or two
ago so
it's been a week of minor injuries
around the house uh i'd say i got stung
by bees yesterday coming back from
giving them water we
keep bees by the way um and uh
the few days before that i had uh well
um
i had been chopping jalapenos and i i
did it was a very spicy one they once
well gone
and i went like that with my finger
and that washing off and it just spread
all over my face just so
much jalapeno oil and i was
dipping like isopropyl alcohol and
hydrogen peroxide to get it gone i don't
know if it was actually good for
my fallout next week
and then uh well one of those times
there's a glow
but it might not be the glow that your
followers want to copy
that's the sunburn one of our longtime
uh sponsors raycon the ones that make
the earbuds um
i loved using them when i was out mowing
the lawn riding lawn mower and
i can actually hear an audiobook while
i'm playing them
i lost one of the earbuds it's somewhere
up front
and i'm not going to find that what i'm
sure but uh sorry i got out of here
headphones and said oh this
even more noise isolating so it's just
very large your phone said i forgot to
put on a hat
because they care for the hat over the
ear buds so four hours of mowing the
back line later
i was utterly sunboarded into those we
were so happy to see the sunshine
after a week of rain it released a week
good god i thought i was gonna have to
build an oak i
was really non-stop in northeast ohio
for like two weeks
all right back to actual questions that
was an actual question
was it yes um another question comes
from claire higgins
i'm a homeschooler can you give
educational recommendations for my 12
year old who loves
all things science we love your channel
um speaking of sponsors brilliant it's
great for science content
um actually sarah probably knew better
than me
we were both homeschooled by the way i
was from age 10 but she actually did
that for her and her younger siblings
and was on the state board of education
for years um
any good suggestions she's shaking your
head no
[Laughter]
um was it for science education
specifically
science for 12 year olds science for 12
years i they're
brilliant really is a good one for that
but a lot of the channels do active
experiments cody's lab
he has a lot of ones you can just do
hands on uh he comes by because he keeps
bees too
um uh if you could find a copy
gerald walker's or the book the flying
circles of physics is full of
you know high school geo high level
experiments that take up one page to
explain them and you could do like that
and uh you know usually on a bunch of a
couple bucks
dewall thank you for your super chat
have you listened to videos or read web
stories of humans
space orcs fairly amusing and possible
that most life evolves on planets like
mars
or is that possible he says he figured
he'd ask because humor is good
actually look at that one real quick
yeah i apologize now the question's over
on the side that was really hard to
actually read them off myself
the stories of humans are spacewalks i
feel like maybe somebody got lost on
that one
all right what's your best stab at it oh
okay i think i got it
okay in the in the there are a lot of
science fiction series where they adapt
you know fancy races you know the orcs
the arms et cetera space cells
in 40k the orcs um migrate from planet
planet on asteroids to cloud things and
all these spore based things so not
actually
a normal life form they are fungus and
there's often the thought that may be
life spreads to other compost like a
a spore or cause you know a fungus on
the panspermia model
uh i don't consider that to be one of
the more likely scenarios
it is on my third or fourth in terms of
it's possible
but not really a lead candidate and so
depending on who you're hearing from is
either
a valid but not too strong theory or
complete nonsense but
it kind of depends on which version
people are going for and if i completely
misunderstood your question was there
sorry
chromageddon thank you for your super
chat of ten dollars
and chroma wants to know if a black hole
engine can be used as a shield during
high speed interstellar travel
or at least to get one going and follow
it or maybe using one as
an aldrin cylinder aldrin cycle
yes sorry my eyes are swelled shut but
you got sunglasses on too
[Laughter]
the uh this comes up a lot as people say
can i use a black hole as a shield
not a classic one a black hole that has
a
a with just like this on your arm length
right like
this size i have to contract them on the
screen so okay because it's much
lighter now this would be like the mass
of mercury
one out here would be woth so
all that mass is in there very very tiny
shield right
um polishing is advancing my offering
automatically on size they're like the
whole sun if it was turned into black
hole would only be about three
kilometers across
and the size of the event horizon that
things can't pass through escape through
uh pass through to get to the other side
is linear with mass
right so you are talking about if you
go from three kilometers across all the
way down just three meters across that's
a difference of a thousand the mass
that's all
that's not even down to the mass of
earth yet you have to get
very very massive where you even get
something the size of your hand right
you're already up in the
bigger than the moon mass just to be the
size of your hand uh
not a good shield for anything you're
trying to prevent coming into you
not a bad place to redirect things to if
you can redirect them but
probably not just make them miss you
entirely um
in terms of using them as a power supply
though it showed
coasting through space sucking gas in
and you know shooting it down there to
provide that thrust
um yeah yeah that's why we like black
holes potential spaceships drive either
for the hawking radiation for
really tiny ones or through that
accretion disk where you get that matter
energy conversion
approach so taco13 wants to know what
your thoughts are on artificial gravity
research
and if it's doable in the near term
probably not
uh a person who discovered an artificial
gravity method though would probably be
it's like the first person really gets
uh professional motion machine working
they'd be
the next trillionaire or the first
trillionaire um and we
see a trillionaire in my lifetime so uh
even without life extension
um the we do have an episode on that
it's the clock tech anti-gravity episode
we spend much time talking about
artificial is anti-gravity there
is a really valuable technology we can
make it work um
we see it mostly in science fiction for
making sure that people don't float
around the deck or have to explain why
the ship's spinning
um but i don't
see any pathways for it i know i used to
like to play around
in a lot of the sci-fi things we
developed as something like um
you know uh instead of photovoltaics you
have photogrammetronics or
neutrino gravitonics where something
absorbs a photon or neutrons that
producing light or electron induces a
graviton
if the graviton is real which all
evidence currently seems to indicate is
the case
then there should be some way to produce
it one would think if you can do that
and some way to produce it non you know
um
non-omni-directionally then not only
should you produce artificial gravity be
sure to do something like a tractor beam
that should be in the realm of science
the pathway to getting there though who
knows
could unidirectional wormholes be
possible
asks sono bello if they only allowed
travel to places so far that you
wouldn't be able to break causality with
them
sure that's one of the more popular
concepts for that would be
uh actually that's another one we played
around the game setting that i'm not
going to mention which one
um if you could have a wormhole that
shots you out
uh a thousand you know light years from
here then you
find the other end there there's you
know theoretically no causality issues
that's how you have the time travel
issue though um i take the mouth at one
point i drag that
other mouth back home now i actually
have that time travel loop issue going
on but it's a closed time-like one so
it's not as bad
um ceo one-horse episode for more
discussion there but the one-way
traversable
wall mostly interested in terms of not
going to to other parts of our universe
but going through different universes
that's where one way of traversable
mohawk is interesting to us
um there's no particular reason why in
this universe of one way traversable
wormhole would be significant
you just make another one that went from
there back so it's just like a freeway
then you got two of them instead of one
that you go
up and down but uh traverse where one
universe would be like
i make a black hole at that black horse
core isn't one more that goes to another
universe i can never come back through
it but i can go out
quite a leap of faith to go through one
yeah really
three questions left here before the
break we have a
super chat from james morris thank you
for your donation james
what do you think will end disability
first bcis and
or regenerative medicine and how do you
think they will interact
um it would depend on which disability
um
norv's well okay the idea behind a bci
is needing a disability and let's let's
take a very specific case here we'll go
with uh
prosthetic hand we still have a lot of
work to get done just be able to make a
prosthetic hand that can really emulate
a human hand that would actually have
good temperature sensors good pressure
sensors
you know that very very crude thing
initially but in order to get that going
you need to be able to redo those nerve
connections
um which means somewhere in there you
have to either be able to put a pair of
jumper cables or alligator clips in
there
as it were to get the connections from
the brain or get the brain to construct
new ones which is also a possibility to
see the bci episode
or you have to be able to regrow or grow
in the first place uh
some people obviously are born without
something in the first place so like no
arm when you're born
you have to be able to actually put that
in there
and either one is going to be the one
that starts ending those kind of
disabilities
and it's a question of which one do we
get first more than which one is the one
that's going to end it
so i would bet a combination too though
because i think if you get
uh a decent amount of like no
regeneration going on it probably won't
be quite perfect and you'll still need
to
have some bci control in there so isaac
verdoe says what will the science
fiction genre look like when
humanity is a k2 or k3 civilization
it's possible it won't actually be
around anymore i mean not every genre is
what you might call a total
specular fiction is right but just an
example
um in the camera the golden age and
silver age specifically is but new wave
science fiction from like the
late 60s and 70s uh which gives some
really good science fiction by folks
like roger's lasting one of my favorites
there was almost no real interest in
hard science and those it was more of
a here are some challenges that science
might give us
and here's the effect it would have on
culture the kind of area should
continue perpetually but we could very
easily hit a point where we have max
download science in a couple of
centuries regardless
of k1 k2 k0 k3 et cetera
um at that point you kind of expect the
science fiction part of it and
you just have specular fiction but even
then you know you start
kind of guessing what's life another
universe like what's the multiverse like
you still have those folks who are
in science fiction traveling to other
universes while you're only traveling
your solar system so
that would be the big change which won't
see planetary science fish and stuff and
they'd still be like well what if we
find ftl so i don't really see the
sci-fi genre eliminating itself anytime
the next
few thousand years at least last
question before the break
ozzymandist2014 would you book a suite
for your 50th anniversary at
blank insert corporate chain here blank
lunar resorts
uh only if they had boone bacon and if
you remember that old joke for the show
then
points for you that's what all the gags
we haven't had around for a while
um if it was actually the point there
was a resort that had people going in
and out of it then
i would seriously be thinking about
making a trip there because
i'm not one of those people is really
all that anxious to try out space white
personally i don't ever need to be
supposed to do plants to fly somewhere
or things like that but
it still would be nice to actually what
about a lunar b and b a lunar b and b
no air b and b there because there's no
ao had to lose
i think that would be a neat thing to
try and i'll see oh or 50 nano force
would be um a few years
yeah maybe 20 70 wouldn't it um we'll
see
all right well we're gonna go break for
a few minutes and we'll be right back
with more your questions
so we'll be on break for a few minutes
so we can all grab a drink get a snack
and while we're on break i thought we'd
touch on our recent end of earth episode
as regular viewers know i write and
record the episodes way in advance
typically 2-3 months before the video
gets made about a week or two before it
airs
and often when doing the video overlays
more materials come to mind
this results in the occasional extended
edition over on nebula which are
sometimes trial balloons for follow-up
episodes too
but for shorter ones we can use the live
stream break and in this case
we were looking at the various cataclysm
scenarios for earth
first though i want to give a quick
shout out to guy haley
his novel belisarius carl the great walk
is the first place i heard someone
suggest
that grey gooey in a planet should
result in compressed and dead molten
layers of them
i'm not sure if he's the first to point
that out or heard it elsewhere
but the novel actually has a lot of hard
sci-fi gems in it
especially on concepts of post-human
minds which is a rarity in shared
settings and space operas which 40k
certainly is so kudos to him for that
and for many other enjoyable novels
the machines diverging into an ecosystem
with predator prey ideas discussed in
that episode though
is inspired by gregory benford's
galactic central soccer which i also
highly recommend
and with some spoilers the nominal bad
guys of that series are machine
intelligence is experimenting on how to
survive proton decay
now i get asked occasionally deal with
civilizations at the end of time episode
on proton decay
it's probably the most requested new
installment of that series after one
focusing on the big rip
and i probably will do both at some
point but there's a reason we haven't
done proton decay
and that's because it's strongly debated
if it even happens
proton decay was very central to a lot
of grand unified theories of the years
and the basic notion is that while the
standard model of particle physics
has the proton as stable never decaying
many theories like supersymmetry or
susie predicted proton decay and had
this idea at its core
neutrons decay they take about 12
minutes to do so on average
but electrons and protons have never
been observed to decay
however we thought they might and had a
minimum half-life of something like a
trillion trillion trillion years last i
checked
i never liked it or the particle zoo of
hypothetical particles we had going when
i was in college
around the turn of the century and it's
probably a big factor in me not
continuing on into nuclear physics in
grad school
if you've ever seen the college ring i
wear the atom and grade on the gemstone
my undergrad advisor at kent state mark
manley was a nuclear physicist
and while i inherited a great level of
astrophysics from my mentor
i eventually acquired a heavy dislike
for the seemingly infinite new
cosmological theories and particle zoos
that seemed to spring up left and right
then
and thus didn't go into nuclear for grad
school even though that had been the
plan at the time
the basic notion of particles versus the
end of the world or universe
is that all matter is made out of
protons so if those decay
our normal matter would cease to exist
within several half-lives of the proton
if that's 10 to the 34th years by 10 to
35th years you would expect only about a
thousandth of the prior matter to still
exist
and by 10 to 36 years 100 half-lives
basically no matter whatsoever to exist
as to the 100 is an absolutely huge
number
which would mean that even civilization
surviving by being digital and
post-human
and slowly trickling matter into black
holes could only make it to this period
which is still a long time as long to
the current age of the universe
as it is to a microsecond but still long
short of the lifetimes of even the
smallest naturally occurring black holes
so it would prevent the scenarios we
looked at in our black hole farming and
iron stars episodes
now mind you that's the minimum
half-life protons might have
and there's no evidence they have a
half-life at all it might be even longer
if it does have one
but if it turns out to be real you have
to eventually alter your civilization to
run on some sort of meson based matter
or something running on positron
electron atoms also called positronium
where an electron is anti-particle of
the positron forms something akin to a
hydrogen atom
this is possible and might make for a
good episode in that series
but it's also something that could be
how earth ends with all matter decaying
as the protons did
and so i thought it probably deserved an
honorable mention in that episode which
again came out this thursday if you
haven't seen it yet
and with all that said let's get back to
our show and back to your questions
and we're back okay our next question is
going to be from gravitaciani
manovar hi arthur and greetings from
serbia
what's your opinion on bracewell probes
being used in our solar system
i imagine something like the centennial
laying dormant and waiting to start
communication with us
say centennial or sentinel probably said
no
i don't know okay um there was a very
classic story by
arthur c clarke uh that uh featured
something called the sentinel which is
kind of the prelude to the whole 2001 um
setting uh that we have with stanley
kubrick later on but
uh baseball probe uh is
similar to von neumann probe but its
purpose is basically without find life
and either chat with it moderate go hunt
it down
and uh if it's a bizarre call blow it up
it's one of a long category
of how would you send a robot out to do
these things and
i have to be honest when we talk about
things like that it does seem like such
of a
you know the early generation trying to
look at you know stellar arc ships and
things like that we're thinking it's
gonna take ten thousand years get the
new solar system because you're using
rocket fuel
or very simple nuclear propulsion or
where you're sending out a really
dumb robot that's freakishly intelligent
kind of the asmovian robot where it's
amazingly sophisticated but stupid
um that is not how ai is going to work
out
you're going to be setting things up of
very parallel to human intelligence
or very simplistic and not even vaguely
sapient um
and we would probably just go ahead and
qualify any probe like that as
manned um see dennisy taylor is
increasingly classic
uh uh we are legion we all bomb sirius
for
what that might actually look like
because he is uh well he's a von neumann
foe but also could be all could be a
baseball poke too
great book thank you merv johnson for
your super chat and he says if you had
an
alcubierre ship and turned on the main
rocket engines while in the warp bubble
at faster than light what would happen
um yeah i'd say called magdaler
miguel or cubier i would probably have
the best answer for that i'm trying to
think of what it might actually be
um the lqr warp drive is basically
working on the assumption we're going to
shut space down in front of us
while we're expanding space behind us
and then we pass that we'll go and
expand some more
um it can't violate relativity because
it's just
changing space in front behind it there
is no need for a drive
on that ship because it's just coasting
lawn that way
but i don't believe there's a particular
reason why you'd have inertia
uh it would actually be an issue or it
generated that behind it is a black hole
for
purposes though so um you might have
some interesting effects off its rocket
flame i'm not too clear on how that
would happen there
but uh it really shouldn't make that
much of a difference
noah r says what date do you predict for
the opening of the first o'neill scale
habitat
sometime in the 22nd century um
it's kind of like the opal ring when we
talk about it and uh
same thing i might have a bad answer on
that could be a warp drive i think
green assault on the last ansel i'll
have to check that because i
think that was right but i i'm it's hard
to think that one through on the top of
my head
um but getting back to your neocenter
oh nico cylinders and orbital rings are
not technologically complicated devices
one is a spinning can and the other is a
hose that's just full of magnetic bits
instead of
you know particles um
you build them when you get to a certain
scale
where you need them not because you can
um when you have thousands and thousands
of people
living and working in space every day
then you might start considering
building a habitat that size but then
why right
what's keeping them all in that one
location why are they at that one as
opposed to a bunch of other smaller ones
so realistically i tend to think you're
going to have to get that point we got a
million people
actively employed up in space traveling
back and forth every day if we start
talking about doing
you know tens of thousands of people
launching space every day
that's when you start thinking being
immediate and ordering
pretty much same place for new or
someone was too i think when you're
stalking that point that
the amount of space industry is on par
with a smaller country
that's probably start to actually start
seeing people considering building those
things for living in
booking and vacation you may have
already started to answer brick muppets
question with that though
um thank you brick muffet for your super
chat of five dollars
and he says do you see any real
advantages to settling mars or
castillo as opposed to o'neill cylinders
and such
what was the second one kalisto i'm
sorry callisto okay um
is one of the interesting moons of
jupiter that gets mentioned less
someone's the focus on ganymede which is
the biggest or europa because it
definitely has that sub-surface ocean
callisto probably has that same stuff
for some ocean just not as impressive as
europa's
um i would actually tend to think that
callisto would be the first one you
caught ice in
the in the jovian system and probably
that would be a place you would colonize
moe's uh you know
we were talking about the case of space
and the oil case for marl's book earlier
by robert zubin
uh and you can go watch all mars versus
moon episode for some of the ups and
downs of it but
mars is not a place that you colonize
because you want to have a lot of new
homes for people it's not
the new american frontier or something
like that uh
it is one of many places you potentially
colonize i
do not think that it's going to turn out
to be well this place we have millions
and millions of people living
until you already have millions and
millions of people living in earth orbit
and on the moon and the asteroid belt
too
i'm having trouble reading some of these
ones with the
bee sting but the canadian says do you
think it's worth using
the waste from fusion to generate more
power than the fusion itself
um
oh okay when i when i take two hydrogen
atoms
just reload plain vanilla hydrogen atoms
um and i ram them together one proton
to another proton i make deuterium i can
then fuse that deuterium again
and we often say determines a lot easier
fuse to get me some
tritium helium helium-3 whichever and i
can use those too i can potentially fuse
those into carbon um
and then diffuse carbon into nitrogen
oxygen
you know silicon or fluorine any of
other things each of these steps
produces more power
the question then becomes would you take
your hydrogens keep fusing over and over
and over again so you already got
pressure
into you basically setting off a small
supernova inside it uh in terms of
what's going on
where you can avoid stuff basically the
ion um
and that's the ideal uh although i
suspect in most cases we got things that
well controlled you'd probably just dump
it down a black hole's accretion disk uh
you know inside its neck
secretion disc instead but um yeah that
would be ideal
probably a long way off though uh
because it just requires so much more
control when we haven't even gotten to
the point we can deteriorate the easiest
of these yet
quarter 10 says isaac do you think that
the brain would have an eventual natural
death if we could rule out physical
deterioration
through the use of spare bodies and how
do you think the brain would respond
yes um every book has its epilogue
uh you're gonna die it's that is going
to happen
uh but it may not happen in the next
century maybe a million years from now a
billion years from now but
whatever you start to find you first
have to say
what am i not what's a human necessarily
that's a good question
what am i and where is the natural tone
in point for me
because um let's say i just keep adding
to your brain let's say we do one of the
pathways the biology which is your brain
just keeps growing bigger and bigger
biologically you go live in a
microgravity environment your thoughts
start taking a century of peace to
happening although they are great and
profound
or we make you post digitals things like
that um
sorry post human digital format there is
a certain point which your personality
has so outdoor
that you can't even be sad to be you
anymore or maybe you've
merged in something else there's always
going to be certain endpoints you start
defining
where is the end point for you years
back we did an episode called digital
death that started looking at what the
realistic half-life might be so to speak
for a human
that was using those methods of
preservation and i'd refer you to that
because we discuss more of the options
there
albert jackinson says good afternoon
isaac you've covered artificial black
holes
on this channel before what artificial
versions of other
astronomical objects could be made and
what applications would they have if any
star wars implants would be the next two
i tend to think of um
i mean obviously we've talked a lot
about making artificial planets uh be
that
shell awards or just natural according
ones we've made
manually um but uh and star wars
obviously fusion would be an example of
that too though as well to remind folks
with fusion
we don't have a problem recreating the
conditions inside the sun that would be
the easy part
problem is if i take a few hundred tons
of solar matter
at the core that's actually during the
fusion i barely have enough energy to
run up a local neighborhood on
it's you know it's not a lot of energy
it's very slow
fusion we need to go higher up to faster
higher pressure um types of reactions to
really do that so
it's arguable for fusion drive really is
a artificial sun
um and i think it was like a watt poor
ton of matter on a red drawer for some
of that or less see one of our fusion
episodes were discussion of that
um other artificial phenomena
possibly supernovas might be something
you might actually generate though more
controlled
um i don't know there's potential value
to things like magnetos or gamma ray
boss
those might actually be interesting
means of propulsion at some point but
that's the only things i could think of
outside my head the big bang would be a
phenomenal we'd like to be able to
replicate you know jp
ventura thank you for your super chat
and he says
if life was to be found on any solar
planet
would it be ethical to terraform it are
we accidentally contaminating mars with
earth life
with drones um you know the big problem
with an ethics question is you actually
have to start off by asking
what is the basis and source of my
ethics um
if i am saying that this planet we found
has
say europa let's say we crack europa
open and we find
inside there is something like an amoeba
and
we'll say debating whether or not it
actually is running on dna or not might
be some distant relative laws a
completely different origin for it et
cetera et cetera and i'd say well we
have to wait to eat all the science done
so
obviously we're not going to get rid of
that life we got a lot of science there
um except that's not really a good more
answer that question because all you
really said is
it's getting a stay of execution because
we want to learn we have a selfish
motivation for doing it
on the other hand what we are talking
about there is a simple
amoeba i don't care about it anymore i
care about the ones in my yoga cultural
so i don't know where the lines are on
that but you have to start by figuring
out
why is this life in some way precious
and that's where you start drawing those
conclusions
uh at the moment though you can say if
we find these things we won't screw with
them too much because the scientific
value is so enormous so
there's just a utilitarian more basis
for keeping around initially
do black holes usually rotate clockwise
or counterclockwise
um not a not a right answer not a right
question um
everything the solar system rotates
clockwise uh around the sun
and the sun as well with a couple of
very minor exceptions because the net
angular momentum of the solar system
has to go in that direction the galaxy
has an angular momentum too
however clockwise and counterclockwise
all based on whether you're up or down
the particle physics we have spin types
but those aren't really real analogies
for
this universe so whether you're
clockwise or counterclockwise it's just
which angle you're looking at
up or down and so from some people's
perspective would seem to be going
clockwise
um but it just depends where you're at
what the net angular momentum is because
in general whatever the net angular
momentum
you know region is that is what most
things are going to spin as
and with time what everything would spin
as it evens out
c.r smith says what is the future of
terror weapons
if i remember correctly the xenomorph
was a biological weapon made by the
prometheans
is that at all possible and what else
can you think up
uh alien was a great movie aliens was
also a great movie
um predator was an awesome movie um
i wish they hadn't mixed those series
together um
i believe it's like when they do robocop
voices tornado and a lot of comic books
it's like don't
don't mix those um they did do a decent
job
i thought i thought the prometheus movie
was actually fairly decent but
um after that they're interested in
looking at this
complex alien life form where they're
willing to sacrifice the crew to bring
it home to spoilers for the plot
is not a good weapon it first they blow
them way left and right
in the aliens movie um the space marines
they are just
bordering them left and right um they do
very well against mostly unknown
people uh and on weaponized people um
they are terrifying predators but uh
they're not really any better of a
weapon than a lion or a shark is would
you like to weaponize those no
not really because a tank is better you
know
uh so i wouldn't expect that to be the
kind of biological life form people use
i really
don't know if i'd ever say that because
you get this bloody line between
self-replicating machinery and biology
at
higher levels of science that either one
obviously has its value as a weapon but
i tend not to think of grey goo or
self-replicators biological or
artificial as
very good weapons they're more like very
good means of deploying
systems of weaponry you know by building
them
jamal anusa says hi arthur greetings
from ghana
my question is with private entities
leading the way do you think
corporations are likely going to take
over the role of government when it
comes to space colonies
um just you know we recently did a
collaboration with what if art history
and that seems like a question more in
his line
um you could like the history of
something like the east india company
um or any number of
companies that were operating in the
what
we call the colonial regions they were
in africa south america
jakarta indonesia um
obviously you have a large organization
whose main goal is profit they cannot
really solve any governmental law
that's going to shift over um but
uh kind of saying for governments you
have a priority that your organization
exists for
as long to mind people we started using
the word corporation to mean for-profit
companies only
corporation is the term that says
basically that we're going to take a
group
and corporate make it a real thing right
uh for purpose
the village you live in is a corporation
it's incorporated
if you live in a village the city is
incorporated uh
many of the non-profit groups should be
familiar with like the red cross these
are corporations
you cooperate with a purpose in mind and
so if your goal is to be a colony maker
then you probably are not cooperating
specifically for profit motive
explicitly oh as your chief priority um
assume whatever the goal of a given
group is that that is going to be what
they
make their main push for and if your
main push is colonization
that's what it's going to be for great
question jamal
next we have sahan yasar and he wants to
know what would be the most memorable
moment of this century of space
exploration
if asteroid mining started
the most memorable moment of space
colonization in this century if asteroid
mining started
yeah at this center um well
i i can give you a couple options uh one
would be they drive the asteroid back
and it
fell out of control and landed on the
planet that would be memorable
that would be bad but memorable two
would be that
that time where they have the the pod
land for the first gold mining thing
and the big you know song and dance
while they got the cameras and they open
it up and behold
vast supplies of gold ballers from space
um
and i could definitely see a an elon
musk or jeff bezos
type personality making it quite the big
show out of that uh unveiling
or tony starkish i should say uh a
little picture of tony stark doing that
instead you can imagine you make quite a
show out of it
um i would say that probably the two big
memorable moments that would probably
come out or something like that that
offer them up is just really sticking
out jp ventura
thank you for your super chat he wants
to know if you have watched terraforming
venus
episodes on the um
kursky koskazak yep channel
and he says it's scary that it reminds
earth four and a half billion years ago
with an artificial moon creation
uh i haven't had occasion to watch that
episode yet i'm told that it basically
takes the porch model that we looked at
in uh winter on venus and and
discussed it briefly so um i have not
had occasion to see that episode yet
chris k says is there any incentive to
visit any other stars
close to ours other than the centauri
system
i'm sorry one more time is there any
incentive
to visit any other stars close to ours
other than the century system
what's the advantage of going to alpha
centauri uh it's because you've got the
same one for chao ceti or for bernard
star
or epsilon you adani or delta bonus all
these
solar systems nearby us uh offer
potential
vast amounts of new boards and resources
new homes um that's the incentive
that's as true to them as the other ones
but that's probably the one
if you mean which one should we visit
first uh i would say
alpha centauri uh probably proxima
specifically but uh
those you know it just makes sense at
the shortest trip and there's a lot of
resources probably there there's bound
to be planets there
bernadette swix says what is the biggest
challenge facing airship
origin orbit projects
um i think the thing the biggest thing
and we talked about this in the sky
platforms episode
people kind of get the idea that we can
lift up a rocket into the air and then
launch it on the back of a balloon
that's an option and it would save you
fuel but there's so much coordination to
doing that
and there are some amazing potential
ways to do that again
we looked at some in sky platforms that
were pretty impressive we have lift up
very large
objects into the upper upper upper
atmosphere
fundamentally though if you want to be
in orbit
you have to actually speed up and
because
otherwise you're just hanging the air
and like an orbital ring permits you to
do that because you can
run around on that track with you know a
supply energy right there to fuel you
and no air slowing you down mass driver
does that same trick
and um but when you get the space towers
when you get to
uh air ships you have to actually have
some way to get that ship moving at
overall speed
otherwise you're just floating you know
and that's not really what you won't be
doing there
david b says hey uh
hey isaac did you watch the tomorrow war
yet and if so how well do you think the
invader monster predators were made
i watched the first minute of it i kept
getting uh poked at me with
amazon prime uh but uh we ended up
watching how's kitchen instead
and i was actually you could see on
facebook the hell's kitchen episode has
resulted in some marvelous creations oh
yeah well
i i still don't really watch a lot of tv
neither does sarah
but we're trying to do some classic
sci-fi we watched the
first episode of barista galactica there
yesterday um the original
battlestar galactica uh the one green is
awesome
um and uh it was nice to catch up on
that then we were watching colombo this
early afternoon um lots of tv shows in
the past i want to catch up on before i
start talking about some new ones i
suppose
um rexy the hound says are you concerned
about population collapse with falling
birth rates across the globe
projected to get worse and worse this
century because the people projecting
these things keep proclaiming it does
not actually make it
even vaguely right um people who do
population projections
um just keep getting the monk
they always get them you can project it
for a decade out because you know what
the behavior mostly is you have to be
off that much because it's easy to guess
i mean you can't be up by more than one
percent um
when i was a little kid they said that
by the year 2020 or whatever it was it
changed a lot
we'd have 16 billion people and we'd all
be cannibalizing each other
uh like a decade ago they said we're
going to have the population drop off it
was six billion at the time of the
century
with eight billion in a year or two um
and
say well population show has started
declining
last century it doubled twice in 100
years in the last 50 years
it's doubled exactly once in 50 years
populations grow as long as they can
comfortably do so
that is how that works the fact that
some countries are having their
population growth rates decline a little
bit
poppy is attributed to many other
factors um most awards are having a
population increase
and i don't see any reason why that
would stop being the case as long as
they had the resources to do that
i really
do not like a lot of the groups that are
protecting the population growth or
decline
they might be right but not from good
solid
proper analysis i think that they cherry
pick a lot
a very great deal the population
is continuing to rise and i believe that
it's going to stop growing
as soon as we have 10 years in a row
where the population growth rate is
less than uh 0.1 percent
uh super chat from el fernandez and he
says how's it going
thank you for your super chat and the
last question will be from mr guns and
otter
he says hello from scotland arthur of
all the myriad
fusion power programs which approach do
you think
will be successful
well i mean kind of all of them are
semi-successful and will be successful
in certain other
details but the tacomac is is it's the
the classic it's my only favorite
there's a lot of ones i like but
probably what was beautiful
um obviously we always like laser
ignition but
the takamak is is is always got my money
on it as the best option
figuratively though because i'm not
gonna invest in fusion research that's
what governments do right now
i just found one more question if you've
got sure yeah
um from bhutan says if the rotor of an
orbital ring breaks up at a single point
will it crash into the earth or fly away
into space
um a space elevator if you cut it will
have it
fly away above the cut and the vest will
fall back down that's how a space layer
works
an open ring if you break it is going to
start falling
through the atmosphere where the
terminal velocity
is usually about a hundred miles an hour
depending on your architectural
um if it crashes it's not going to leave
a crater
the way an asteroid would it will leave
a hole
directly underneath it possibly a little
bit wider than it is so if you go build
an orbital ring that's like a kilometer
across
even that comes down it's gonna shake
the earth right but uh if you have one
that's only
you know 10 meters across then anyone
who's actually living directly
underneath it
or within maybe 100 meters is in danger
potentially um big thing though is
we have ways of slowing objects down you
put bolts in to cause the sections to
separate you know explosive boom and
then you probably have
you know some uh parachutes deploy on it
i think we've discussed that in the open
rings episode
and it could just slow down more but
it's going to fall down on your house
the same way an electrical wire would in
terms of being
some damage but might not even kill
people inside that house it just depends
how big the opera ring is
they're not asteroids they're coming in
at tone of velocity not asteroid
velocity
any others are we done for the that was
the
last question for the day last question
for the day it's after five o'clock
it is after five o'clock eastern time my
eyes are swelling shut i can't
read any more questions all right i'll
get you some more antics to me it's not
going to get out of the suit jacket and
we're going to see you all on thursday
thank you so much for joining us
