One of the keys to settling our solar system, 
or other systems later down the road, will be  
bringing in water to barren planets or artificial 
space habitats. Comets are ideal for this,  
as they already enter the inner system, can 
be more economically redirected to a planet  
or habitat and are mostly made of ices of water, 
methane, and ammonia, vital elements for life,  
but they are relatively few in number, and you 
may need a million large comets to bring oceans  
to just one world. The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud 
beyond though are full of icy bodies containing  
orders of magnitude more water than Earth’s own 
oceans. The hydrogen or deuterium in these could  
be used to run a fusion reactor and provide 
propellant for the drive system to move one,  
but it may be easier to beam energy out to a 
comet from the Sun and use this to superheat  
the ices to work as a rocket or ion thruster. See 
our episode Comet Mining for further discussion.
