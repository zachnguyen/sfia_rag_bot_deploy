good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink
and a snack though we'll take a break
about halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
our monthly livestream q a
for august 2020. we'll get to everyone's
questions just a moment
if you want to start posting those in
the chat window we do have a few that we
have from last time saved out that we're
going to try to get to while you're
getting your questions in
sarah it's great to be with you isaac
and today we have
uh several questions from last month
starting with
this one it says hi isaac i love your
work do you think it is more likely that
we will colonize mars with under 1
million people
or develop space habitats like o'neill
cylinders with the same population
we don't really know how humans gonna
fail under low gravity yet
if the answer is not very well then the
o'neill cylinder for sure
however the thing about mars is while
it's a great source of resources
it still has that lower gravity which if
you adjust to is probably not going to
be as comfortable for a lot of folks we
might think so
we could see a terraformed mars that has
billions of people in it
and we have discussed some extreme
methods for terraforming like for
gravity of dumping a black hole to the
center of it
but i would just tend to guess on
average that we'd see a lot more folks
living on neo cylinders and probably a
lot sooner
any start off mammal space is probably
going to be relatively small
under a million people for i'd say
centuries to come
thank you dax one asked will the
technological singularity come before
the predicted year of 2045
you know the entire idea of the
technological singularity is based off
of moore's law which is the idea that
transistor speed doubles or transitional
size
halves uh every two years or 18 months
depending on which version you're going
with
that has not really been true for a
while and we're starting to get to that
hard limits you
can't really build a semiconductor too
small because it's made out of atoms
and we've already got them down to the
nanometer scale and not
you know hundreds of nanometers just 10
for instance
so you can't just keep that going
indefinitely now you can obviously start
increasing processing power just by
making your chips bigger making this
thing bigger but
the idea that you're just going to have
this take-off rate with a technological
singularity has never really made much
sense to me
the basic idea is that if i design an ai
that's a little bit smaller than a human
it can turn around the next day and
design ai that's just a little bit
smaller than itself
and one that's a little bit smaller than
itself the next day or the next minute
and so on
um we've been trying to make smarter
people for a very long time
um we've been throwing more than one
person at it you know thousands of
people at least have been trying to make
smarter people
for thousands of years and just
kind of looking around civilization
these days i would say that we've had
limited success on that score so i don't
think we should assume one ai is going
to turn itself over and make a smarter
ai the next day
so the 2045 prediction for technological
singularity
and i thought other numbers fought too
as as soon as a few years from now as
soon as a few years from now a decade
ago
and 20 years now or a century from now
it could happen but i just don't think
we really look at it from the right
perspective
tangent one says i like to think of
gravity as matter radiation
i do wonder if it is the result of one
or more of the other forces leaking
their force of attraction
one of the other forces in the sense of
electromagnetism or the strong or weak
nuclear force really wouldn't fit
um however there is a similar notion to
that
uh out of string theory which is the
idea that
gravity is actually a force that is all
across the multiverse
and that's why it's so weak as it's
radiating out in all those directions to
cover all of them
uh which is an iffy proposition but it's
one of the ways we can explain why
gravity is just so much weaker
now the other three physical forces are
not equal in strength but they it's a
range between about
one to a hundred and difference between
all three of those they're all
pretty close together and that might
sound like a big difference still one
against a hundred but to give you a
scale for that
to get to the weakest of those gravity
would need to be a trillion
trillion trillion times stronger than it
is now
um and i think i might be under bullying
that a little bit so it's a very weak
force since the only one that's
attractive
there are also some notions for like
dark energy potentially being uh the
repulsive force of gravity and things
like that or
anti-gravity which we discussed a bit of
in the well the anti-gravity episode
clock tech anti-gravity but
for right now that's mostly just theory
and uh i just
can't see it really being an
electromagnetic force and the strong and
weak nuclear forces don't really fit uh
see the anti-matter episode for
more description on how those two work
great well it looks like we've got a lot
of questions coming in so let's jump
into some from today
first jake krauss says what do you
personally believe is on the other side
of a black hole event horizon
um more black hole there's kind of a bit
of a
bad notion we have about event horizons
that comes from
the hollywood portrayal of them and in
fact they got their name from the
disney company um black holes
have an event horizon where light can't
escape from but if you start falling
into a black hole
you never reach that event horizon even
ignoring that you'll probably be killed
by it
even if you're one of the really big
ones that doesn't have the tidal forces
as you approach it the event horizon
runs away from you
and if i throw something at the same
time as you you'd still be able to see
that object for instance you'd be able
to communicate with an object you fell
in it's only when you get over the event
horizon related to something that's
outside the black hole
that they would see you disappear over
that horizon so the event horizon always
runs away from you and would keep
running away from you right until you
got to that center
singularity or plank scale planck star
or whatever it turns out to be and
potentially there might be other
universes on the other side of that
there could be
a warm horse to other parts of our
universe inside of that
uh they might spawn whole new universes
there's so many theories for that and we
did look at some of those
in the ultimate realities and parallel
universes episode
um i think the warm horse episode too
very interesting humanity first the
xenos second says
do you think we could ever effectively
communicate with aliens
as much as sci-fi shows show like star
trek
or are aliens just too different uh the
40k reference in there i would say that
uh probably well we do actually have
that episode recently did talkative
aliens and that that inspired me about
another episode
and i cannot hear what that's called at
the moment terrified aliens um
out for october 34th or 27th right for
halloween
talking to aliens and we did look that
more in cryptic aliens too
you could potentially talk to them but
their mindset's gonna be a lot different
than
than ours it's going to be a completely
different track if they exist to be able
to talk to them at all
we'd expect some similarities you know
they're going to have a similar
evolutionary pathway if that's how these
things worked out for them
but um there's so much variation in that
so it probably
the best you'd hope for is that they
would be like talking to a very small
dolphin or elephant but given the
differences in
so many factors of their culture as well
as their evolution
you'd be lucky if there was much in
common beyond just the general belief
that
you should both try to survive and uh
that's not really a lot of shared ground
when you think about it since if you
both have the shared goal of survival
and expansion of your species that might
cause you to bump heads man
um thank you thought criminal for your
donation
and their question is what are the odds
that there will be another dark age
within the third millennium
such as a natalie carlin's theory of the
age of malthusian
industrialism uh well there's two things
on there i
generally don't like the term dark age
um there was obviously some
technological lost in western europe
after the fall of the roman empire's
western southeast far rome
but i think that tends to get you know
history's kind of made a bit out of that
that's
maybe more than it was there was
actually a lot of science done the dark
age
uh in some ways they were more advanced
again that was just western europe that
we're talking about
um it was kind of a romanticization of a
literally with the tone of that ward of
the renaissance period trying to draw
roots back to the greco-roman era
um and that's debatable you ask a
different historian you didn't answer
but
the other one on that is the malthusian
cataclysm idea um i'm not familiar with
that particular version of it that you
mentioned malthusian industrialism but
i am not a big big fan of malthusian
beliefs
um and uh rob with zuppan who most you
know from case for
mars um he did a book uh that a friend
of our community called merchants of
despair that actually
really really bites into the idea of
malthusianism uh pretty heavily
and points out that generally when
population increases you actually get
higher productivity out of each
individual person
there's obviously a whole limit on that
if you have a set amount of resources no
matter how efficient you get using them
if you can't increase them well there is
a point at which the pie cannot be cut
in two more pieces so the basic premise
is fundamentally right if you keep
doubling your population to find out
universal events you're going to hit a
malthusian catastrophe
but that's also assuming that people are
stupid and um
we overdo that a little bit people are
not stupid
if they see that there's going to be
hard times ahead if they just keep
having more and more people
they will start to take measures and you
can argue that the western civilizations
have already done that in places like
europe where they are pretty high
population density
but uh by and large i do not tend to
like the
uh either cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic
take on
civilizations falling under their own
weight and malthusian cataclysms
that's an opinion obviously
okay we have several questions here from
zachary
what are your thoughts on neuralink and
secondly
rigid airships for venus and also thank
you to zachary for
a donation as well thank you zach uh
well we did
talk about both of those in mind
augmentation uh that episode and
in the you know i can't remember it was
winter on venus or colonizing venus that
we looked at the airships thing in
detail i remember
so here potato he's one of our animators
on the show
uh he did some i'm using something
amazing well i'm using two
renderings of some airships neo
platforms from uh for that episode for
colonized venus
um and for sky platforms episode i like
the idea of rigid airships
as a way to get a basic settlement or
outpost on mars because you can float in
the upper atmosphere there
and the nice thing about venus is
because it's got so much carbon dioxide
you can float with just oxygen nitrogen
you don't need helium
and if you're floating over the place
where they're going to be nice and
buoyant you can actually find an area
where the temperature is
livable you can't see it as the major
way you colonize the place unless you're
going to go for a
full-on shell ward in which case i think
you'd rather do something rigid as
opposed to
simply going for a lighter than aircraft
um
what was the other part of neural link
the problem with no link and there's
been a lot of progress on it's amazing
uh in that mind augmentation episode i
did link
the uh resource they were doing on that
in summary form
it's amazing what they've been able to
do like plugging 3000 connections into
one mouse's brain
but there's still a lot of progress that
needs to be done on that for it will be
anything that we can
well even use on animals let alone
humans but it does show a lot of
progress and it's it's the first real
progress size i think it's taken from
science fiction to science fair you know
science fact
and i really do think we'll have things
along those lines inside the next decade
in commercial application maybe two but
um
we'll start using it for medical
purposes things like helping out the
site impaired or uh
you know audio impaired probably a lot
sooner than that and might see
great use in prosthetics alexander
i'm sorry i don't think i can pronounce
the last name properly parker
can you do an episode on reanimating the
dead as a halloween special
we already have a halloween special for
this year it's terrifying aliens
um oh that actually does sound like a
fun episode
uh um thought criminal
also made a donation and has another
question
what do you think of the effective
altruism movement
organizations like the center on
long-term risk and suffering
abolitionists like brian thomasic
i'd be honest i'm not really familiar
with those it strikes a vague
recollection but i'm hesitant to speak
against so many organizations and
i could be mixing them up right now um
if you want to get with me after the
episode just post that in the comments
and i'll come back and find and give you
a
better response than i'm not sure what
you were talking about hopefully
daniel alcantara perez says
do you think biotechnology will solve
mankind's shortcomings before we begin
space colonization potentially it kind
of depends on what you mean by
well biotechnology and space
colonization are both things that are
very incremental you do them in bits and
pieces
and you could actually have one develop
faster than the other
and um well sometimes technologies give
each other good feedback
been advancing the one advance to the
other paired up together so they really
advance very quickly together
other times you have bits of uh delay
because of it as an example
we actually came up with um with solar
power before we were using the internal
combustion engine regularly
um but it was very weak which is copper
oxides and we hadn't discovered
semiconductors yet
if somebody had noticed that
semiconductor principle back in say
19 well let's say 1895 before henry ford
events of the car
we could easily end up doing a lot more
research into improving those and
uh batteries and start doing something
like electric cars in the
1910s or something like that and so that
might be an example
where one technology kind of displaces
another to some degree
um i don't see though that biotechnology
and space technology would actually tend
to interfere with each other indeed
cybernetics um that's what we always
think of for attaching a machine to a
human
originally meant uh just augmenting
people with either biotechnology or
medical technology for the specific
purpose of space settlement to place
like
zero gravity the moon or mars so i think
they'll be very tied up together
and i think the one big difference is
everyone's pretty much in favor of space
colonization uh
opposition to it is generally just it's
expensive right that's about the extent
of people's objection to colonising
space
uh most people are in favor of it at
least especially if the price can be
brought down to a reasonable amount
biotechnology is a little bit different
there's a long range of potential
objections you have to deal with them
from you know ethical
cultural whereas space colonization
doesn't have to be interfered with
those so you could easily see the one
stagnated technology while the other
advanced
because it had more enthusiasm less
resistance
moon dog says hi isaac what is your
academic background
uh let's see um i was a homeschooler as
my wife was as well
until i was 16 i started college at kent
state university
i was a physics major there i graduated
top of my class
in what was that two thousand that's
actually a little ring in 2001 getting
hold on
if you forget what day you graduated uh
well it's it's interesting i started
grad school the week before i graduated
um
so uh when i was 20 i graduated from
college top my class in physics at kent
state
and i stuck around there to start
working on my doctorate uh and i
actually started that
right before i graduated because my
professor who uh was
quite anxious to get into biotechnology
time research and so
we were starting to play around that
that summer and i stuck around there
until
late 2003 when i joined the army uh
during the war so i never did finish up
the doctorate
and to be honest i have very little
desire to go back to it though i
finished up all the graduate coursework
on stuff like electromagnetism quantum
etc
i just did not have the energy or
passion to stick around to actually do a
thesis on a specialty and i have to say
that i've only ever
briefly considered actually going back
and doing that at some point so beyond
that
um i just keep studying like i used to
do before i was in college and doing
college so
we have a donation from travis neal
thank you
and a question from albert jackson hi
isaac it's nice to be here again given
the recent prominence of online
education due to the pandemic
what are your thoughts on the future of
education in terms of format curriculum
etc
uh it's actually something better
qualified than me to talk about that
um online education just looking at from
when i opened ohio we're obviously
trying to do that with the virus uh
pandemic right now
and we are trying to get classes back in
that's gonna vary from state to state
and country to country
but you're gonna see an online component
that uh we always thought this spring
you're gonna see more of it
it's kind of advancing the timetable on
a lot of these things and as you know a
lot of the spots for the show are online
education
um uh companies like brilliant or
skillshare
so we are seeing a big improvement on
those and i remember in the
late 80s and early 90s we had some very
basic computer programs we use and those
were already kind of fun
like math crunch or organ trail um
and so they are nothing like what we get
nowadays and that's going to keep
improving one of the things i would
expect to see a lot more of is kind of
going away from
the you know uh not nine to five but
whatever time kids go to school at so
i'm home school
um seven to three like eight
eight eight o'clock to three that
kids go monday to friday and um
uh and not for the summers is that we
probably see
less of that in favor of a couple days
of instruction and maybe some of it
online because you still need that one
one-on-one or in-person stuff a lot too
um but uh where i see how these things
develop and i expect
crisis often brings opportunities and
and
you know necessity is the mother
invention i suspect a couple of
innovative ways of doing online
education mixed with in-person education
next year or so
at the same time in 20-30 years
absolutely
but we'll start seeing a software that
can do things like read the students you
know
eye interest their contact with the text
they're reading or little things like
the temperature of the body and say
this student is finding the material
they're reading or watching right now
boy
and you can say okay well this was the
history of x you know
version one let's switch over to version
two you know same information different
presentation format of focus
and it tries that out the student said i
find that boy and it tries out version
three
and say oh and they're wrapped attention
little tiny things like that and
especially building up build up data on
the individual student
might allow us to do a lot more of the
one thing that is not available to us
right now with online or automated
education
which is that student teacher feedback
ability and that ability to find out
what the student is enthused about
and teach to that and that i think would
be the biggest thing we could probably
see is advancement in education
technology
hopefully in the next generation sooner
the better
melancholy says if there was another
full-scale space race between the united
states and china
on colonizing the moon what do you think
the overarching goal would be
and who do you think would reach it
first
um i mean if it was
well the first thing to point out is the
united states already reached uh the
moon over 50 years ago so
first place is kind of taken um the
biggest reason why no one has done since
then is not a lack of technology
russia could put someone on the moon
within a year or two when we did maybe a
little longer
um at most china inside the 80s that
they really wanted to probably could
have they took about about their space
program but they certainly could now
they really wanted to
and that's one thing that we're going to
look at um we're continuing the becoming
interplanetary species episode that will
be
uh our episode 3 of that is on the moon
uh and
talking about what we need for the bases
there and we've done quite a few
episodes on the moon so a wonderful
topic to discuss
going to the moon is not a problem
finding a reason to go to the moon
to justify the cost and risk is a
problem
and it is one of those catch-22s the
moon is so useful to outer space
um but you have to have a development in
space first and to develop that stuff in
space cheaply
you need access to the moon and its
resources and so on so it's going to be
a slow
progress of back and forth as to who
gets there first um
whoever does in terms of like a opponent
base you know it might be a private
company like spacex
and other countries just rent stuff from
them you know they just lease territory
um or your lab space it might be united
states might be russia it might be china
it might be the ea
the european space agency it could be a
number of people and whoever does kudos
them you know it's a nicer race that
encourages people to walk out and hurdle
but uh we all win regardless who gets
there first
thank you lucas springer for your
contribution
he says thanks for everything you do
there are very smart people thinking we
are in a time of accelerating
technological progress
others think we are in a time of
technological stagnation
where do you land well i i would have a
whole time
understanding how we get the idea of
technological stagnation potentially we
might be plateauing out
which uh and i think you do ultimately
plateau out with technology
in a finite universe with set physical
laws you're eventually going to figure
out what all those laws are
and after that you'll start developing
all the useful technologies for them
we've only been doing science for 400
years in sort of real sense and really
only the last century
we've been having you know thousands of
people who made a full-time possession
uh profession
um there will be kind of eventually a
maximum on science and technology
in terms of understanding this universe
if there's multiverses or parallel
realities we can get access to
that knowledge can keep expanding but in
the finite universe there's a finite set
of rules and knowledge you can have
about it
um as to whether or not we have
accelerating technology
that is arguably the case but it
sometimes involves cherry picking
as an example you could look and say
well we've doubled progress on this say
well how are we measuring this
and so one of the ways that we very
rarely measure this is by looking at how
much money is spent on it and how many
resources are in that field
once an area looks like it's interesting
like computers we tend to dump a lot of
money and people into it
and often that results in a big boom to
your next
gains some which are very easy others
it's you know it's like a mountain the
first five or six
feet are easy the next five or six feet
or even harder especially if you're
trying to jump
so um you know you have to be kind of
careful how you're measuring progress on
things of like the technological
scientific nature
we are clearly making progress that's
about all i can say
i guess this would be a similar question
from will reynolds he says
do you think we will see manufacturing
of electronics in space
in our lifetime yes um
i mean depending how old you are
obviously
uh you know episode kickstarting space
industry we brought up several options
that might be very appealing as
economies
um and obviously one of the ones that i
as kickstarters that i thought was very
good was power satellites
another that's often suggested of course
is the ability to actually bring in gold
or platinum from asteroids
um the ones we do in terms of
manufacturing these might be secondary
knock-on effects you've got the industry
in place for
manufacturing x y or z in space uh and
so you can easily rent out or more
cheaply establish a facility up there to
make things in space
and electronics are very based on semi
electrodes and crystals
and zero gravity not only gives you much
better growing conditions for crystals
in most cases it also offers you some
options in which are not possible on the
gravity period
so yes once we can actually get away
with manufacturing
electronic components in space we'll be
right there doing it there are things
that we just cannot do on earth that we
can do in low gravity
rhys jones thank you for your
contribution says
space is hostile how do we protect
against radiation
remembering the rocket equation and
being on a planet with a thin atmosphere
and no magn
excuse me magnetosphere mars most
uh mars has some atmosphere in
magnetosphere and actually is
enough to provide a limited amount of
protection compared to something like
the moon
um the most dangerous place near us to
really be dealing with it is actually
not empty space itself but
the short bands like the van allen
radiation belt or the
magnesium jupiter because it collects in
ionizing radiation that like bounce
around inside there
um charged particles you know actually
with magnetosphere
but i need antimatter in some cases but
uh
the biggest and best way to shield
yourself against radiation
is with just regular or dumb matter um
there are certain types of radiation you
ought to want to use multiple types of
layering because it's more effective in
some
but as an example the bigger you make
your spaceships and we make them very
tiny right now because we have to do
everything on the cheap
the bigger you make your spaceships the
cheaper it is to shoot them
because of this cube square law if i
make a ship twice as wide
and radius and all those things just
doubling it in size
it now has eight times the value in
cargo capacity and
has four times the surface area to
protect well if we can stuff eight times
the mass on there
and shield it to the same thickness for
four times the mass we're only spending
half our budget of matter on that so we
can just keep building the ship bigger
and thicker skin
still have to pay the fuel ball for that
for things like space stations or things
that are actually on planets this is
less of a big deal especially if you're
a resource harvest you have some place
like the moon or an asteroid
and don't have to pay the fuel bill to
get to that location well at least a
little one
for spaceships it's always going to be a
problem and that's why bigo is often
better in case like this because you can
store all your spare water
in the outer hole as your tanks right
water is a great
mothball it's a great shield against
radiation as well as a moderator for
nuclear power which we'll talk about in
two weeks
but as a whole you can just store your
extra material
extra equipment on the outside of the
hole and keep your organic or radiation
sensor materials
in towards the center and that's an
advantage you get from having a bigger
ship
so that's one way you can help with
radiation shielding on the cheap
as to other options like powerful
magnets around it to create your own
magnetosphere
that helps against charged particles and
that's one way to avoid those but not
other types of radiation like gamma
so you use a combination ah well maybe
big is the answer to the next
question from 40 96 because he answered
every question
he says voice isn't woking you're not
using enough of it
he says what is the best way to protect
the spaceship's crew from the cosmic
rays
how effective is a magnetic field at
deflecting the particles from the crew
compartment
uh if it's powerful enough magnets if
you're dumping up energy into it for
instance electromagnets um
very effective against charged particles
they have to be charged that's the big
thing about it it has to be your
hydrogen atom or you know muon or things
like that that actually will interact
strongly with the electromagnetic field
there
now it's not nearly as much as people
tend to think though i can't really
exact power budget
to create a ring around mars that would
be as good as our own magnetosphere but
i think it was like 10 to the 16th watts
which is a lot of power or it was less
than that but it was a lot of power but
it was wondering
what the solar budget would be so if
you're trying to terraform planet you
put like mirrors and shades in place
you can create that magnetosphere a lot
cheaper and i think it was a lot less
than 10 to the 16th um
but it was a lot of power but nowhere
near what we'd expected to be
um compared to the effort you need to
like restart the core of moles or spin a
place up
like that now as to spacecraft you can
be done a lot
less but the key to you know bouncing
those around you need a very big field
to start spitting them out
deflecting them early out or needs to be
very strong um
and we have a lot of options for that
and of course we can power them with
solar power because the nice thing about
space is that it's not dark
it's always you know daytime in space so
your solar works very well there
uh for powering things like
electromagnetics to shield the ship
thank you simon farmer for your donation
and simon's question is when will we see
an
episode on the interdiction hypothesis
solution to the fermi paradox
interdiction hypothesis um china if we
actually did do an episode on that i'll
leave it again
in a moment and simon farmer i think
he's actually one of our focuses but
around since like year two i mean
every so often i recognize one of the
names i hope with jack and synolio
um okay so interdiction hypothesis
is one of the phobia parox solutions
that relies on the notion that they just
don't really let
um well first read the quantity
hypothesis which is the one where we're
basically kept in a zoo or something
similar
they are all out there but they don't
want us to know they exist or get out
interdiction's a little bit different
interdiction is uh agreed upon self
quarantine
which is basically the idea that you
know several species will have very
large demilitarized zones so they just
stay away from each other
they are they agree to expand always so
far and limit contact to either none or
very very little
and the usual notion of that is that
they have come to believe that there's
just no real way to
have peaceful relations on a day-to-day
basis
and this comes to well kind of douglas
m's notion about the babel fish his uh
um little fish but here that would tell
you about what other languages being
spoken just translate them to it
and said the babel fish by causing uh
easy communication has caused more
and bloodier wars than anything else in
history sometimes
um getting to know people it does not
make you want to spend more time with
them and it was concerned that aliens
might just be so different than us and
again that's something we'll be looking
at terrifying aliens
that the better we got to know them the
less we want to do with them
and that's kind of a core concept of
interdiction hypothesis
is that you can be at peace with almost
anyone if you're far away from them
and have very limited exchanges but as
to whether or not you'd be good friends
with them if you're actually sharing
borders in space and tensions and
regular interaction and entertainment
we don't know and the introduction
hypothesis basically walks around the
idea that you'd be leaving bubbles
around
any plant you found that had sentient
life on it to give them room to expand
and that's why we can't hear them it is
just such a big gulf around every planet
it looks like we have time for another
question here before the break
um andre jones thank you for your
donation and he
she says my friend likes sci-fi books
with an emphasis on worships
worship battles and complex science
rooted concepts
which book or books would you recommend
there's a lot of them
um you know the go-to for military
science fiction uh is often david
webber's honor voice uh starting with on
basilisk station
and i'm very fond of that series though
only up to maybe about book eight or so
he is very very good there about having
good characters a good setting and
a very plausible you know he takes the
special sciences that they hand wave
into that thing
after like fast night travel and he
makes sure that they're using it
properly it's not like a lot of times
they basically magical technology they
ignore all its other beneficial effects
um
other ones so good i was very fond of
marky cooper's i came up with the series
called monkey cooper's sci-fi series
well if you google marky cooper that
would be the series you'll come up with
uh it covers very well with cybernetics
and all the expansion of humanity
in the stars i'm trying to get what
other really good sci-fi ones there are
that are both military
sci-fi and um
and very scientifically accurate because
you have to have to hand weight as a
secondary focus
um aleister reynolds does pretty
scientifically accurate stuff but it's
not really what i call military sci-fi
so
there are a lot of options uh the
publisher bain b-a-e-n tends to be one
of the big ones for military sci-fi
and there's uh a friend of mine operates
a site called military sci-fi
i cannot remember what the
actual.neto.com is but that's a good one
so
lots of options there available to you
and uh we'll be back from the break in
just a moment and then we'll get
more your questions while we are taking
a quick break
it's a good chance to get some questions
in for all moderators to grab and
forward to me
and if you want to increase the odds it
will get answered and be nice to all
mods
try to keep it clear and concise and
watch the typos
however we won't get to every question
and normally i come back in a while
after the live stream to watch the
replay and to answer any questions left
in the comments
after today's show though we will also
be having a discord
live chat on the sfia discord server
linked in the video description though
we do ask everyone to enable the push to
talk option
and respect everyone else there which is
to say
if you have already asked a question try
to let others get theirs in before
asking another
and don't talk over top of other people
especially when they're asking a
question
or i'm trying to apply to it you can
also stick
questions and replies in the text
channel attached to the audio chat
again though please remember to go into
your settings on discord
and change them to the push to talk
before joining the conversation
hey everybody i'm jerry gern i'm a
scientist and an engineer out here in
san diego
and i'm a frequent sfia editor and
occasional
uh script co-writer um isaac has stepped
away to take care of some important
futurist business that he needed to take
care of so i just wanted to
pop in and say hi um i uh
also write science fiction and fantasy
stories in my free time
and um a year ago isaac strongly
encouraged me to start my own youtube
channel and start posting some of my
stories
so a bunch of you'd listen to momentum
uh thank you for all the great comments
that you posted on that one
um i was really pleasantly surprised and
overwhelmed by the reaction to that
story
in the past year i posted a bunch more
stories uh the quarantine has given me
lots of time to write
um so the most recently the most recent
story that i posted is called
paleontology it's a slightly dark but
fun
time travel story and i think it's a
good time for a time travel story
because the uh epidemic has a lot of us
wishing we could go visit a different
year for a while um
so anyway check that out um i think
isaac
is just about done with that futurism
business he was uh he had to go take
care of
so uh just quickly uh my channel is
called jerry's stories because
i'm jerry and on the channel are my
stories and uh
be sure to check out the uh upcoming
episode fermi paradox the phosphorus
problem
really cool episode i wrote the
chemistry parts and i learned a lot
about the astrophysics parts from isaac
it was a really good
collaboration it's a cool episode so be
sure to check that out
and everybody stay safe uh have a great
time and
back to isaac before we get back to the
show
i want to take a quick moment to thank
all the volunteers who help out on that
show
from the mods helping out and sending me
questions for our chat today
and who will be helping moderate our
discord after our show
to all the other mods on facebook reddit
twitter
our website isaacartha.net and of course
youtube itself
in recent live streams we've often
featured folks who help out on script
editing and graphic design
and of course you get to see those folks
who help make the episodes in the credit
roll on each episode
the show wouldn't be half as good
without their help but that's only part
of the show
sfia isn't just about me talking about
some topic for half an hour each week
it's about all the discussion and
questions and random brainstorming
all of you do afterwards we've built up
a phenomenal community
in terms of size courtesy and cleverness
and it's a wonder for me to behold
but none of that would be possible
without all the moderators helping keep
things
organized and running if you're not
already part of one of those communities
i suggest popping in and giving it a try
as they're always full of stimulating
conversation
and while you're there give a quick
thanks and shout out
to all the mods for all of their hard
work
and now back to our show
okay and we're back very good now i just
have to figure out
what questions we had here um scott
seabrook says hi isaac just curious as
to whether you see any potential utility
in
rash limits for instance using neptune
to break up
jupiter belts i'm sorry cupid belt
objects or
creating dust shades around planets or
etc love your work
um you know that's actually one thing
you might use them for i
tend to like the idea of using them to
break up but well for kyper objects one
of the big ones that's out there is the
comets of course
and you really don't want to slam a
planet like mars with
a six kilometer wide comet if you can
avoid it
so if you can put it into a slow orbit
do it can just kind of roast limit break
down and then start falling down
that might be an approach the other hand
though is that's likely to set you a
very large debris field
and in the case of terraforming being
sort of struck in the first place you
might say
screw it and just drop the thing right
down there and let it burn up and
crash get some new cradle lakes um and
there's already water right on hand for
them to fill up with
um that's not true they vaporize the
waters came down but
uh i would say that for roach limits the
debris issue is what's gonna be a
constraint factor of using them
uh potentially for objects that are very
loosely held together you might surround
them with a much stronger
structural material and just kind of
take them into orbit
where they just kind of break up inside
that but to be honest i don't think
there'd be too much utility to them that
i can think of at this time
hebron ibro says isaac hi
i just recently started watching your
videos where do you get your inspiration
um you know
my cat just came in a bit of a sign
though while i'm thinking of where the
inspiration comes from
i made the mistake of installing a cat
door in my office so my cats come in and
out while i was recording
and um i found out from my nephew uh
abel that it was also the perfect high
for toddlers to stick their heads there
too
so that's what their arms at various
other sundry parts of their bodies when
they want to wave and smile
so my great big mutant cat my great big
golden mutant cat flax is going inside
he's gonna come jump up on me at the
moment i used polydactyl with paws
literally about this big i'm sure that's
part of the inspiration oh yeah
well actually cats are often inspiration
for me uh inspiration
um science fiction's a lot of it you
know i grew up watching star trek and
doctor who
uh star trek the next generation came
out when i was
seven or eight and uh i fell in love
with it in deep space nine i was a big
fan of tom baker so was my mom used to
watch on pbs all the time
you know carl said again isaac asthma of
course is a big one for me too
uh here's one of my two namesakes i was
also named for newton but uh
my mom was a big asthma fan as my
grandpa so
you know he had over 500 books and i
guess we probably had at least 100 of
them in the house
um and then college and then the
internet forums talking with the
audience
i'd say these days at least 50 of our
episodes are inspired by
something either one of the audience
members uh says one of the polls or one
of the production teams chess and it
just sticks in my head
uh you were just hearing from jerry
giron a moment ago and uh
we have in three or four weeks the uh
fermi paradox phosphorus episode
and that was his brainchild he said you
know why did we do all this he sold me
on i think he was
he was so very easy on the 40 paradox
idea but
inspiration comes from all over the
place and i'm grateful for all of it
don cdxx says isaac would you consider
the great attractor as a possible techno
signature of intelligent life trying to
keep matter close
as cosmic inflation pushes it all away
you know we did an episode uh was dark
flow in the great attractor as part of
our dark trilogy of uh dark matter dark
algae and dark flow none of which are
really related to each other in the tone
dark which in physics is kind of like we
call prototype you know
something x you know the ml the x8 right
it just means prototype
in physics dark basically means we don't
know
um think about the great attractor is it
sounds so mysterious especially because
it's in the zone of avoidance
and i say it's actually the second zone
of avoidance the first sort of avoidance
uh this is what you're trying to avoid
telescopes is the ground you always want
to avoid pointing your telescope with
the ground
the other place you want to avoid
putting your telescope at is the center
of our galaxy which the big milky way
about because it's so hard to see
anything through that if you try to look
for the galaxies the great attractor is
in that direction
um and so it is possible it's a
technological
you know signature of some species
decide to get really aggressive or clock
tech in terms of dealing with the
expansion of the universe
but it's more likely that's just the
rough center of the super cholesterol
complex or
other large object is made of atoms for
the ones at the uh
scale of hundreds of millions of light
years but that's probably just this
rough center and we're getting pulled
slightly towards it
problem is we're actually not getting
pulled towards the center of it and you
can see that episode for a lot of the
details but
we're still going away from it very fast
it's just we're going away from it a
little bit slower than we're going away
from everything else because it does
have a pretty impressive amount of
gravity
but it's just enough for us to notice it
more the house
ft says relating to the boltzmann brain
if there is the chance of nearly
anything happening or being created over
time
there must be a chance that after death
we could be reincarnated
yeah in any system that has an infinite
factor to it whether it's infinite time
or infinite space and matter um
there's only so many things a product
will be assembled into right
so same as you shuffle the deck of cards
enough times you are eventually going to
get it right back in the same order you
started with
you could shuffle matter around enough
to exactly recreate
you and you might actually you also have
a case we exactly recreated you
with your memories of oh i thought i
just died and you thought you jumped
forward in time
we look at that more on the infinite and
probability issues episode and some of
the conceptual problems of that a lot of
our boston brain episode
um for instance you will have a universe
in the multiverse or an infinite period
of time
where someone is surprisingly convinced
they have created a fashion like
wormhole technology
what they've actually created is
something that if you step through it
kills you
and yet somewhere by free coincidence
there just happened to be
an exact copy of them pop out of the
location just out of the void
right uh by random quantum chains the
odds of which are
insanely tiny like 10 to the 10 to the
77th or something along those lines a
huge number
but it's still finite so if the universe
it will have happened and they'll also
be the occasion where having done that
that person builds that generator again
and in one version of that he does
successfully not destroy himself but we
appeal again
and every time people use this it works
even though it absolutely does not
just by freak luck um that's what
happens when you start playing with
infinity in case like this
um in any finite any finite probability
in infinite universe over either
infinite space over time
something will happen over and over and
over and over again
right but that's still so it's an
insanely tiny number and
our best evidence right now says that we
do live in a finite universe
and a finite period of time thank you
sean aspie
for your donation and his question is
what are your thoughts on the bob lazar
phenomenon do you think he really saw
alien spacecraft from another solar
system
possibly um you know when it comes to
eyewitness testimony
and we're actually looking in
mid-october i believe
at uh at the three navy ufo footage
sites because that want to pull
so i'm stuck doing it um i don't really
try to avoid covering phenomena
specific phenom phenological events um
because i don't like to impugn witnesses
people see stuff
some of them might be lying some of them
might just be insane but probably they
saw what they saw
and it might not be what they thought it
was
quite probably it was not but at the
same time i'm just not happy calling
people liars and i'm not inhabitants
just
assuming that you real things all monday
because all science is based around
finding those
exceptions to where the real thing
really is weird and finding out why it's
weird
um on the same note though you know bob
is always a bit of a controversial
figure
and i am very doubtful a lot of the
transuranic
materials he's mentioned discussing so
thank you maris tudex for your donation
and she says thank you very much for the
endless hours of entertainment and
knowledge
could we use very powerful lasers to
manipulate matter over great distances
this way building probes on distant
planets
yes and no optical tweezers are one way
to move a matter around that's very
appealing at the atomic level because
we just can't really make anything small
enough to get in there if that's made
out of hard matter
uh problem is light even a laser format
we tend to think of a laser beam
as a tight beam that stays as a tight
beam forever it does not
it keeps spreading out by inverse square
law same as normal life does
it's just very focused in to begin with
um
and if you were trying to manipulate say
a star if you you know if you got two
laser beams
one at alpha centauri and one at uh back
here
very powerful well focused beams you
could find something that was
an angle to both them and give it push
and start that laser beam around
that would be insanely difficult to
coordinate and given the power that was
involved that laser you'd probably be
better off just sending a probe out
there to do it but
it's possible you know and again the
nice thing about light beams is they do
travel at the speed of light and no
probe can do that fast so
the next question we have is from braden
isaac do you think quantum computers
could get their own version of moore's
law
something like processor speeds doubling
every x amount of years or even months
yes and no i think that we will see a
big expansion in quantum computing you
know you have
um and the problem is moore's law
well as more himself having embedded it
is not a law you know it relies on
essentially a coincidence you look at
the original data right
it was not doubling every couple years
it was going up a decent amount going up
another decent amount and if you kind of
co-fit it it
roughly was doubling and if you zoomed
out a little bit more it wasn't
you know it's increases happen as
discreet events
and you know you're not going you find
something that lets you triple the
technology that year and then you go
four years that as any improvements or
minor refinements
so and and this is something i like to
warn people with things like
technological signalities
don't don't curve extrapolate you know
the you cannot just say well double this
year and double next year so it's going
to always keep doubling
this is just not how this stuff works
discrete individual events took place
that made these improvements
if they coincidentally happen to double
you know over x period of time
you zoom out for a little bit longer
looking at a lot of times here you see
that it did not
in a longer period of time beyond that
this is just not the progress that works
at cosby make some very bad assumptions
to predict the future i think
brick muppet thank you for your donation
their question is mercury is kind of
hard to get to
but does mercury's fast relative orbit
give any meaningful delta-v
advantage to launches from that planet
is it enough to affect viability of
mining there
you know it's something people tend to
miss about mars and we just have
launched window two malls
is when we shoot spacecraft off to mars
they actually have to be shot backwards
and slow down to catch up because mars
goes slower than us um venus goes faster
and more could be fastest yet
auto speed is basically related to how
close you are to an object
um the closer the faster now that makes
mars a very interesting place to
potentially be building spacecraft and
winging them out
into space especially because you can
build a big laser platform and open if
they are light powered by the sun and
push that thing
real fast outside solar system too uh
for distiller purposes not that useful
for interplanetary it might be a very
nice place for
resource harvesting but the thing to
remember is that something speed
its upper speed is related to how close
is the sun because it has to be going
that fast
not to fall down as it goes further away
gravity pulls on and slows down
so you know you launch it out of there
but it's trying to escape the sun's
gravity well at that point it will slow
down a bit
uh as to my itself that's essentially it
comes down to the
the escape velocity of mars which is i
want to say
actually a little higher than more than
mars for milky way but uh mars and
mercury
same surface gravity mercury is a little
bit denser than mars because don't have
any of the light elements they're all
burned away
jonathan says have you read any news
sci-fi and what's your favorite book
from the past
five years i don't know if they need
five years maybe five days
i actually am beginning to read as much
as i i probably should of the last
couple of years um
so i think the most recent book i
finished was uh
actually the most recent book i finished
listening to was a black company novel
which is fantasy
um let's see and i was a 40k novel i'd
listened to recently too
um new sci-fi
um
there is actually a ton of it i'm just
trying to get what it actually is of
late
and the next one that came to mind was i
was hoping jerry uh proof is one story
of late um that we mentioned during the
break um
hmm favorite sci-fi over the last five
years might be a better one
and i'd actually say it was probably the
prefect or sequel
elysium fire from australia reynolds was
probably not a surprise i was a big fan
of him
um but uh that would probably be my
favorite of late
for sci-fi zurich zorowski says
isaac why don't we have any space hooks
yet just
why in your opinion and of course i will
appreciate and greetings from poland
um you know i'll cover this jacob grigor
who's the longest volunteer on the show
is from poland too
um and i just want to thank him real
quick because
we've had people come and go over the
years as volunteers to get busy but
jacob's been here
forced one volunteer still here every
week so
um let's see and i completely forgot
what the question was
[Laughter]
why do uh why don't we have space hooks
yet
um skyhooks work best in tandem
with uh with hypersonic aircraft and we
did look at some of the scramjet options
for that in the space planes episode
and of course potentially that with a
mass driver that's uh you know a shorter
and faster and easier build than
anything that would launch something
right to orbit
um so skyhooks got looked at a lot in
the hassle program
in 2000 and i think we probably would
have been pushing more towards them
except
and i was talking earlier about how
sometimes an improvement to one
technology can slow another down
spacex has done such an amazing job with
reusable rockets that the space plane
snowings and skyhooks noisemen kind of
pushed the back boner for a while
um but if we certainly saw a massive
improvement in our capacity to
manufacture our carbon nanotubes
or graphene and industrial levels i
think they make a rapid reappearance
but i'd say that's probably the biggest
one pointing back right now ironically
is that we're doing so good with
reusable rockets
chris's question is how are we
determining the mass of whole galaxies
to detect
dark matter it seems that it would be
hard to pin down an
accurate mass for so many stars dust and
rocks
this is his first question thanks chris
it is very
very very hard to pin down the mass of
galaxies
um you can start looking for the
research from uh hubble zero in the
1930s and i can't was
wiki i think it was the same might have
been zwiki was the one who first
proposed dark matter
we have a number of ways that we
estimate and what we try to do is
compare them separately and if they
actually match up these different
estimation patterns that we usually were
on the right goal
the first and easiest way is to look at
a bunch of galaxies and
guess how many stars there are based on
the luminosity the brightness and how
that inventory comes up
and say based on that number of stars
this galaxy which has you know half
again as much brightness
is uh you know half as bright as half as
massive
that would be one way to estimate
another will be to look at two galaxies
that are relatively
near each other and see how much they
are curving towards each other from
gravity
as opposed to expansion from hubble
expansion uh another way we can look at
that would be satellite galaxies
around them much smaller ones and see
how quickly they are orbiting by seeing
the redshift on them compared to the
redshift of that other object
this is one of the many ways we estimate
them we just keep building up
guesstimates and locations and
comparing them against each other and
then slowly correcting as we go
dark matter is the tricky part though
because most of the matter in the
universe is
dark most matter is not in stars and
this is before you can get into dark
matter specifically
we had to estimate how much it was from
gases and things like that and we
estimate how much
gas there is by basically looking
towards an object and looking towards
another object
twice as far away for instance and
seeing how much it's light's been
diminished in a certain
frequency you know that gets absorbed
spectral lines of hydrogen for instance
and say well this object has more of it
absorbed
it must be twice far away that kind of
thing
and so we got a pretty good idea what
the density of local space was in terms
of matter that wasn't in stars
and it wasn't enough we still noticed
that even in the 1930s
and so we said well we've got all this
matter we've estimated by so many
different methods of regular matter
he said we've got something that has a
gravitational effect and we can see it
by how caused the galaxies to spin or
attract to each other
we can see the gravitational footprint
of them and we see no other footprint at
all
whatever it was was dark dark dark not
like infrared or on the radio spectrum
or absorbing things
it just had no interaction with universe
whatsoever other than gravity
and this is where we get dark matter
from and that is the basic origin of
that name
and so basically by seeing the
gravitational impact of it we see the
stuff
and all we can tell right now is it
tends to clump up around galaxies but it
doesn't really clump up in the same way
matter does because it's interacting
with itself so it can't slow down and
form stuff
the way we normally do with things like
accretion disks or rings around plants
to eventually form
an object jonathan wants to know if you
ever re-watch your old videos
very occasionally um you know what's
interesting is i almost never watch a
video after i render it
uh that's why the production crew is so
grateful i'm so great for them is they
go back and check for arrows because i
can't stand watching them when i just
finished working on them
because it's it's i've just been
watching it on and off as i did the
clips together
um but i do like to re-watch them
occasionally usually if we're doing
another episode from the same series
or on a similar topic i'll go back and
see you know any given episode we have a
lot of material that just doesn't make
it
it's in the draft or it's in my head and
doesn't quite make it to the draft even
that i want to talk about but it wasn't
time and so
i'll go back and listen to an old
episode on a parallel topic and say
well here's the basics i need to recover
but here's the other stuff i didn't get
a chance to talk about i now go and do
that
or sometimes we actually go back and
watch the stuff from uh season one or
the original episode just to
kind of remind myself how much progress
i've made in terms of visual and audio
quality
sometimes so uh it's a humbling
experience at times too
fallen god thank you for your donation
says
thank you for sharing your thoughts love
your show how long do you think it will
be before we attempt an o'neill cylinder
um i guess kind of comes down we're
talking about full blown original and
what usually will mean is the island
three one
um but uh the really big one or if you
mean something a little bit more modest
for a given value of modest like the
planner uh station that uh brian
versteef designed
um and uh
something like that or like the gateways
one that's just a basic gravity one that
simulates either moon gravity or mars
gravity or earth gravity
i think we'll see a very basic markup of
that inside the next generation or so
uh but the bigger ones even kaplana
weighs like 10 megatons
it's a lot of material to take up the
space um you need to be able to start
resource obviously out the moon so i
would say within 10 to 20 years of when
we actually have a serious operation set
up on the moon
or potentially on asteroids same
difference for that context
then you'll start seeing big space
stations getting planned and build
until then it's just cost prohibitive
johnny wings says will you ever do a
tour to other countries for talks or
their sci-fi conventions
we'd love to see you in ireland hey i
want to go to ireland do we okay so
there's event island maybe we'll head
out there um
i've actually only done one speaking
engagement in in public at all
uh since that's channel started that i
didn't even do this show that was down
at the uh
carnegie science center last year uh dan
the void invited me down to give one of
their talks
um and uh that say
i was supposed to be going down to
dallas texas uh to uh
to give a talk to the uh the nss the
national space society at the uh
international space development
conference uh however
covet until that's done i don't know
i've been trying to actually
you know open myself up to actually
going and giving live talks a little bit
more often
but it's it's obviously had a bit of a
footnote based on i'd say the odds of it
depend very strongly these days on
whether or not it's near a good vacation
or interesting vacation spot because or
if i can convince you to go
yeah exactly which is probably much more
likely to happen if it's a good vacation
spot
but uh until the virus is done yeah who
knows
salman suleman says if you had an
unlimited budget for an experiment in
space with current technology what would
you do
for an experiment specifically i mean
i could argue that since we need to find
out what the impact of low gravity is on
humans that building on your cellular
spending at martian gravity levels is an
experiment
so that would be what i would end up
building the other one of course would
be a giant bigger telescope like the
planetary refractor lens we looked at in
well in the mega telescopes episode so
as
if people occasionally say this was a
click bait episode that wasn't what
was on the uh you know what the title
says i don't get that very often because
no matter how strange the episode sounds
uh for our show
it's usually exactly what's printed on
the can like colonizing the sun
but um mega telescopes will be the
episode where we talked about the really
big telescopes and that would be one of
the things i do for
strictly scientific gain uh otherwise
i'd comfortably either build an orbital
ring or a audio solder
isaac bordeaux did i ask this one it
says um what do you think is the most
accurate representation of an
interstellar empire in science fiction
no no uh the most accurate oh that's a
hard one um
i will occasionally joke that the most
accurate sides fire and privacy at the
interstellar scale
is warhammer 40ks and perium because
they really get the idea of ancient
behemoth that just
is a mess from everybody you know years
and years of single lag and time
and tens of thousands of years of
passage of historical events
and you know populations in the
quadrillions
they naturally nailed that part very
well in a dystopian way in terms of
interstellar empires
uh house of sons by allstar reynolds
kind of looks at that idea
uh though they're not so much interested
in empires just the idea of a continuity
of a civilization over
hundreds of thousands of years and light
years in terms of other ones
it's you know
the problem with trying to write science
fiction that has to do with
sub-like travel is that you either
confine yourself to a given solar system
or a handful for a specific event or you
pretty much give up on the idea of an
empire
and so you don't really see to me set
that way because the writer wants to
show you a galactic empire
they don't want to have one where the
phone calls take a million years
so i think that's probably why you don't
see too much realism with that
if you've got fast night travel then any
number of them the uh empire from
foundation series by asthma
dune buys the asthma of uh just named
another dude by frank hobart
another big one's uh ando's game series
in terms of the uh
i can't believe it's called the uh
league he has in the later books after i
was game though that's a very good one
by also scott called
so there's a lot of them out there but
they all assume fashion my travel
so sam biswas thank you for your
donation
it's and his question is is it really
possible for someone to become a literal
god just by being a genius
no the question itself was inspired by a
quote from rick
and morty uh you know interesting aspect
of rick and morty is
that i usually think rick's character is
designed to be kind of intentionally
in despair of nihilism but uh you know
anything that's finite cannot make
itself infinite by what you think of as
normal logical progression
now whether or not they could pass for
god to say the ancient greeks
anybody nowadays who's got them you know
someone's accessed a bunch of technology
and a time travel machine could do that
so it just depends on what you mean by
that term
sapiet says what if we made the
underground cities by building above
ground
on earth and then cover the series of
cover
with a series of tunnels with dirt and
maybe make some ponds above some clear
or frosty glass
to get light down there for a sense of
day and night
you can do that yeah to some degree you
might always see that skylighting effect
but the thing is the light that we get
from the sun is very very bright you
don't even tend to notice that when you
walk in from outdoors that you've walked
into a room that's got about one percent
the light of it and you still think it's
fairly bright because your eyes are
logarithmic it's also got all sorts of
frequencies we don't really need like
the infrared
so if you're building up layers and
layers and layers of places
you probably will skip on the sk you
know the uh skylights in favor of
artificial light most places but you
might do that you might have the big
you know open dome at the top let's
light into various
facilities going a long way down or you
might just build up so much that ground
floor effectively becomes
underground um and we look at that in
mega cities which is
next month this month sometime soon the
mega cities episode
uh where we look at uh basically how
these really huge cities we see in
science fiction might tend to actually
operate
i think this was actually part of that
question um
it goes on what if we use partial
shading and solar evaporated water
piped to the deserts and released during
the day
into dew condensers and during the night
time out in the atmosphere
to get liquid water and if we use
fresnel mirror walls to heat up large
parts of russia and canada without
actually causing global warming
making them hot enough to use as
temperate climate farmland
as well as balloons to get run light
into the arctic circle by having the
light coming from an altitude where
there is light
see the colonizing the arctic episode um
you know we did look at a lot of those
options
uh for that and and if you've seen the
earth 2.0 series
we do cover a bunch of options like
reclaiming the deserts or warming up the
core regions or subterranean
civilizations and that those are
actually uh three of the episodes
a lot of sky cities which was fun to do
um but
essentially you've got short-term and
long-term options you know you could be
putting lenses up in space to
block sunlight or redirect it to parts
the planet for instance
um but uh old balloons you know it could
be just you put a big
balloon floating up there that's kind of
me on this office you do want to be a
little bit careful changing around the
temperatures in places like the arctic
though because you can have some very
unexpected effects on the ecology from
things like that but at the same time
um you know you want to get water in the
desert it's very cheap to pump water up
and into a continent
and you can just cover with plastic or
glass and greenhouses grow food inside
those greenhouses and then take the
wallets evaporated from that salt water
you pumped in there
and use it to irrigate fields around
there and that's the idea of a
greenhouse evaporation or sea greenhouse
evaporation that some folks have
discussed
i'm going to wrap up with just two more
before we go to the discord after hours
and the real goliath wants to know what
do you do during the break
uh sometimes i just go give me a cup of
coffee sometimes i i
but basically i just take a bit of a
break um and
i'll leave it everyone's imagination
right whatever i'm doing and
uh yeah so i take a break and
catch my breath and i don't know if i
ever mentioned it so if you we have a
fair amount of light here
not as much as studio lights we usually
have but you get really warm uh with
those i usually have the air conditioner
blasting right before this so it's loud
as heck and i turned off the show
and lastly jordan morley wants to know
what who are your favorite scientists
and futurists you know i was actually a
little bit surprised recently because i
was looking up a few colleges i didn't
recognize they put up a wikipedia list
of
of famous futurists and futurologists
and it was about 150 people on there
and i was one of them so
uh and i did recognize about half them
uh there are a lot of them you know
that you can look at and i'd say rob
zubin would be example
very cool as well although i tend to
disagree with a lot of the singularity
aspects
um and then it depends on what you mean
somebody's sci-fi office would count uh
and i can't remember why his name's not
kidding me right now um vonnovinge he's
another good one for uh for computers
and that sort of thing
and you could think of alzheimer's one
um
there are a lot of them out there and i
don't really have a personal favorite
uh other than maybe just by bias isaac
asthma for the classical days or joel's
phones you know
and uh you know it's the joke is your
good futurist if you're right 51
of the time so for those of you uh who
will be joining us for the discord after
hours
please do make sure to turn on your um
push to talk button before you get in
there i'll probably be in
about 10 to 15 minutes then we're
starting at 5 30 officially
and uh we'll probably run to about 6 30
i got coming at seven so
we're trying to get a good hour in there
and and thank you so much for joining us
this week and if you need that link it
is down in the description
and we will see you on thursday
so that wraps up our live stream for
today but we are not done yet
as mentioned we'll be doing an after
hours live voice chat
over on the sfia discord server linked
in the video description
where you can keep asking me questions
live for an hour or so
i'll be in there shortly after the show
ends but if you miss me
feel free to leave questions in the
comments on this video and i'll try to
get back in this evening to answer them
i hope to hear from you there but if not
i'll see you thursday
you
