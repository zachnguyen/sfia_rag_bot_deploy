good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the sfia monthly live stream q a
we'll get started in just a moment but
go ahead and start getting your
questions in the chat window
so our moderators can start relaying
those to me as soon as we start
please try to keep the questions concise
and watch your spelling
and try to be polite to others in the
chat we usually go for about an hour so
you probably want to grab a drink
and a snack though we'll take a break
about halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
our show we'll be getting to your
questions just a moment so go ahead and
get them into the chat window
and we have a few left over from last
month we didn't have a chance to answer
to and we're just going to start with
those
uh reading the questions off to me as
usual of late is my wife sarah
thank you isaac the first question we
had from
last month was milan janick
and he says isaac arthur sorry i missed
this month's video stream
what do you think how big space is
around planet earth that we can
confidently say that has no space-faring
technological civilizations
thanks and i love your channel i guess
it kind of depends what you mean by
confidence
um where everything with forming paradox
is concerned we usually say
we have no idea what the actual answer
is yet none really
fit well but if we're going kind of with
the dyson dilemma ocean that
civilizations will expand to the point
that they
pretty much take over the entire galaxy
and utilize all the stars in that area
that we're not seeing any within you
know a billion light years of us doing
that
we tend to imply that we're not gonna
see much further away in that either
because they wouldn't be around yet
if the universe is much younger two
billion light years away and the light
from them is two billion years ago
i usually say half a billion to about a
billion light years and we could say
confidently is not exhibiting
any signs of that thus far and again
since we have a much
widening value of space further we go
out even though those more recent
civilizations from say half a billion
light years away or 2 million light
years away
would be more recent easier for c and
presumably order
um the fact that you're going out so
much further and getting so much new
stars and galaxies when you go out twice
as far away
just kind of statistically works out to
make it very improbable that these ones
further out that were
just a little bit older thank you
we also have a question from gregor
samsa my apologies if this has been
discussed elsewhere on the channel
could dark matter or energy be a
solution to the fermi paradox
could it be that advanced knowledge of
physics leads to technology
and or materials that appears to us as
dark energy or matter
um it's very probable that since dark
matter is the majority of the matter in
the universe that that's going to be
high on everyone's list to make use of
though you won't see any reason why they
wouldn't make use of other matter while
they're at it
the issue is that we can look back in
time to see dark matter we can only see
dark matter based on
its effect on things gravitationally
and it seems like based on our current
theories
it actually was part of the formation of
the various galaxies but either way you
can look
13 billion light years away where the
light is 13 billion years old and the
universe was really only 700 million
years at that point and say
there is the clear effect of dark matter
in play
and that would seem like that would be
way too soon for any civilization like
ours
to have potentially have done anything
with that at that point in time so
dark matter is probably a very great
interest to advance civilizations
but it wouldn't be what dark matter
actually is to us
so jumping into questions from today we
have divide by
zero get cake could you see a type 2
civilization intentionally creating a
black dwarf to study it
um you know when you get around to what
a black dwarf is which is a white dwarf
that's just cooled off
um those could be produced artificially
but it's still very time consuming
process
i don't think they'd find all that
interesting with a
white dwarf right towards the water left
over when you're done with a normal star
the most star is written up as a white
dwarf eventually
only about one in 100 ends up as a
neutron star and won the millions of
black hole
uh in fact that 100 for neutron star was
probably high too
um everything else ends up as a white
dwarf and it's not burning anymore at
that point times just cooling off but
it's very hot so it takes billions of
years to cool down
to the point where you wouldn't see it
giving off a visible glow
that's where it starts getting the black
dwarf territory although that's a
debatable point some would say it's a
black dwarf when it no longer gives off
visible light just infrared
others would say it's when it's cooled
down to about the temperature of the
ambient temperature of the universe
and trying to cool off big objects like
that faster than
nature would allow by just radiation can
certainly be done
it's just i'm not sure what they'd be
looking to get out of that information
per se
um could they have done it yeah they'll
white house all over the place and uh
once you get down to a reasonable
temperature you can start cooling them
manually but
uh i don't know if they would have um
i don't actually have the control of the
questions on the oh
just to use the mouse there it's not
working it's not nope
so i'll ask you a question but i might
be jumping over some
matthew campbell says a bit of a silly
question but if we suddenly discovered a
way to clone dinosaurs would we expect
them
or modified dinosaurs to be weaponized
like in jurassic park
uh you know there's there's many mac
cameras in my life i used to have a
roommate who was one another's an editor
for the show and i'm guessing it is the
latter we just asked that question since
that sounds like something matt would
ask
um would we weaponize dinosaurs if we
could make dinosaurs
i don't know but it sounds fun
like uh trans source rex has got gatling
guns on the side of it
um i can imagine that we might but
i'm not really certain what the utility
of it would be
other than the rule of cool so if you
can make dinosaurs
you probably would weaponize them and
again a trans source wax is already
weaponized by its very nature okay i've
got the use of this back
it says jonathan could you use an ai
controlled disco ball to extend the
effective range of laser weapons in
space
i i don't really think a disco ball in
of itself would would really assist the
uh
it's just that too much even if you put
a mirror out there that you could bounce
it off to be able to change the angle
um yes um i think the way you would do
that is you'd have a mirror that was
reasonably mobile and could get signals
and so you'd post out for it to change
the direction but the first you know a
blast of the
of the laser and the laser would follow
behind as it was rotating into place
um i suppose you could do a discover
setup for that
um i i don't know that you necessarily
would unless you're really into 70s
music i
personally um hope that everything
involving the 70s stays in the 1970s and
does not see any sort of revival
there's very little of quality uh from
the 70s in terms of
fashion that we need to need to be
bringing back i think
arter renato bb what are your thoughts
on increasingly available
semi-classical computation methods
available commercially
for example photonic or spintronic
circuits
photonic circuits optical computing in
general is
um but i guess it depends on how small
you can make your diodes
um it's got some applications to be sure
it's not my area of expertise so i'm
going to limit what i say on that
but we do see some things besides
semiconductors as
ways to do computation we even talked
about using mechanical ones
then you're made out of very tiny
amounts of like narrow odds or graphene
um there would be some applications
where there was probably
much better uh especially certain things
where they shake around a lot it helps
to
not be too dependent on something it's
going to shake you like your solid state
technology but
i'm not really explanatory to give you
too many details on what its
applications are going to be
the key to despot dear isaac if or when
we create a universal assembler
what further innovations in maturing
manufacturing nanotechnology is possible
beyond that
or is that as far as we can go under
known science
said that's a fun username a k2 desktop
because you'll be meaning so many rules
over an entire dyson sphere or dyson
swap
which again typically would have more of
a population than the typical galactic
empire we see in science fiction
all right um manufacturing
with 3d printing shows a lot of ability
to be able to rapidly prototype things
as well as create some devices that we
really couldn't
create on an industrial you know typical
line production anyway
as to universal assemblers this is kind
of the same notion
very rarely will 3d printing ever
produce something faster than line
assembly classic manufacturing would
and you can bet that universal
assemblies will be the same way
we have this image from sci-fi of the
little grey goo things rapidly
swarming over things and change them and
more themselves as fast as uh
you know as fast as a puddle of water
spills this is not how that would work
it's a slow process
the smaller you go the slower it
probably tends to go in some degrees too
but in terms of its major manufacturing
assets it's very like the 3d printing
that allows yourself
very intricately it also allows you to
do stuff at the self-replicating level
we see the time low machines as
self-replicating because there's no
other way you could really have them
you're not going to
mass print a trillion of them right on
the individual mill with somebody
walking there with a magnifying glass
and a little poker putting together a
little tiny robot
but the other day they were just a
clanking self-replicator and they would
never be as efficient as a bigger one
in terms of how fast they put stuff out
um
that's pulling out bigger copies of
itself so assume that all manufacturing
at the atomic or molecular level is just
way slower but if it's self-replicating
it doesn't really matter if it's slow
you just get the job done
and that is ultimately the big one there
to me it's
you got that whole biological angle you
put the little nano robots into people
where we really can't
do a lot of stuff on people right now
but you can also start creating your
self-repairing technology that's the
really nice
one that's where you start having the
computer that's capable of a self
upgrade when it gets the patch update
not just
software but it's hardware that's we
start getting the you know the
walls of the house that never need to be
cleaned or repainted because they just
get cleaned and repainted by the
nano robots every day same for roads
cars all sorts of things so
really durable technology in the sense
of self-healing technology is to me
probably the biggest advantage that
stuff
in terms of commercial applications
thank you the next question is from
albert
jackinson what would be the effects of
advanced
ar vr nanotechnology bcis
and cybernetics on society on a related
note
would there be anywhere for interfaces
to go after advanced
ar and vr okay so we have the acronym
problem we always have anything else in
life
for those who don't know vr of course is
virtual technology
ar is augmented reality uh sorry vr's
virtual reality
ar is augmented reality and bci is brain
computer interface uh or mmi
mind machine interface take your pick um
augmented reality if you're not familiar
with it is kind of like your heads-up
displays
it will be the notion as you're walking
through a crowd of people um
right into your vision you're going to
see a lame tag appear above their head
says
sarah fowler or something right you just
pop up next to their head
or similar things like that where you're
still walking around in normal reality
there's no change to the reality around
you you're just augmenting it with
little add-ons
soon as you wear like a pair of glasses
smart glasses things like that only
presumably more advanced technology on
that would be to the point where
you're trying to fix something uh and
the blueprint for it shows up over top
of it
or you can just pull the video in the
corner of your eye that's going to walk
you through it
and the more augmented reality you get
the more it just seamlessly fits on top
of the reality you're in again with
examples like that where it might be
putting up these subtitles or someone
speaking to your different language
or because not just visual it might just
be translating what they say
as they say it into real and really
advanced augmented reality
you're sitting there talking to someone
would change their lip speed for you
it would just blow that so that you know
now you're seeing them talk as though
they're normally talking in english for
instance if they are speaking in french
and does the full translation audio and
the visual part change their lips around
to fit the symbols and sounds they're
making
so that would be very high-tech
augmented reality and that's kind of
what that
would be a good example of how that
would be
um see on the other question
and that would be a good example of how
that would fit into society too at a
day-to-day level that's your smartphone
application people just don't expect
um that very casual way of just
accessing information
was there would there be anywhere for
interfaces to go
after advanced they are in vr there's a
lot so much we could potentially improve
that on i mean you have to start adding
things like smells taste
touch but uh unless you start rewiring
the brain to have uh
augmented senses itself like where you
can see infrared or you could see
ultraviolet
or you could smell touch right or you
could uh
smell um gamma radiation or you just had
a much higher resolution of your
eyeballs
unless you start augmenting the human
brain uh with bcis or things like that
you are kind of maxed out once you get
your augmented reality or your virtual
reality up to the same resolution
in all five senses that we experience
day-to-day life in
for instance the human eyeball has about
20 000 pixels across
as it's a resolution we're not quite
there yet even with 8k
obviously we have a question from
g4r0s what kind of science disciplines
do you expect to see in the near future
will science itself change i mean i
guess science is
always changing to some degree but the
ground principles should not
change and sadly they sometimes do get a
little bit changed these days in
application
the scientific principle is about
gathering evidence for experimentation
to conform a theory
and to always present it as a
falsifiable one i don't see a lot of
room for that one to change or advance
but individual techniques for performing
it
could as for new scientific disciplines
cognitive science is going to keep
expanding no surprise there um
and actually why now it's fueled to the
point where it's likely to uh
to be um multi-disciplinary itself
we already have for instance psychology
or neurology as separate fields
i think you're probably going to see
that whole area kind of re-emerge and
separate out into new disciplines at
some point in time they might keep the
same names but you'll have a lot of
cross training into it
um zero gravity engineering would
probably be a scientific discipline we
should start to expect
seeing in our duties in future or low
gravity engineering uh
beyond that i mean computation and
ecology biology genetics those will be
areas continue to improve
medicine too you'll see more disciplines
coming out of those we learn more things
that we can make disciples out of
the bakka that chews star lifting the
sun would make it live longer
but would it cause earth to become
tidally locked
and change orbit given enough time
the earth would tidally lock but it's
very easy to prevent a planet from
tidally locking if you're engaging the
levels of engineering that you do for
stop lifting
there's nothing specific about star
lifting that would cause a plant to
tidally lock
tidal locking again is a very slow
process that basically
um i think we did an episode on title
locking way back but
picture a wheel that you've kind of
pushed on a little bit so it's a little
bit lopsided
and it's it's wider on one side than is
narrow that's kind of pointing towards
the main object
it's it's it's advancing towards like
you know like that here's the earth
uh the thing is that because it's
spinning the lump
has to settle back down in place it's
constantly pulling off the top but that
lump is slightly cocked off to an angle
the peak of your lump is not actually
pointing at earth on the moon for
instance or a non-toxic object
and so that pulls it just a little bit
from that angle towards the planet
and that causes a very slow breaking
force we did do an episode on that title
locking
i think it was like episode six so way
back there uh if you want to get a
little bit more details on that but that
is the process of tidal locking and i
can't the only reason why star lifting
specifically would play into that
but again the process is so slow for
something like earth against billions of
years it hasn't happened yet that
you can easily apply a little bit of
force uh way beneath the threshold of
what be involved in star lifting to keep
it spinning if for some reason you've
extended the stars life
to the point that earth has time to slow
down to be tied locked
which at last estimate i think was 40
billion years to tackle the ark or that
might have been the earth timing off to
the moon
here's a question i presume not from the
presidential candidate but
from someone that
is going by the name bernie sanders what
future application can you see for
gravitational lensing
especially for space telescopes could it
be potentially done
artificially yes though you you might
want to ask if you really would want to
be using all that
mass to uh to just make a lens since you
have to fly out there to do it
um any place you're making a big
gravitational lens uh you could just go
put a telescope there
much easier than building like a black
hole to be making a gravitational lens
what you're mostly doing with
gravitational lensing is trying to find
existing
objects black holes galactic dust dark
matter spots around galaxies the halos
that allow a very good amount of natural
gravitational lensing
so i don't think that's really one you'd
be using artificially too much
but if you were building great big black
holes for your civilization for instance
you might go ahead and start using those
for the additional purpose
of amplifying signals between various
ones using the gravitational lensing to
enhance transmission
we have a super chat from arcanger given
your one of your recent
episodes do you think it unlikely that
we will max out a dyson swarm with wrong
worlds of mckendree cylinders
um well the the wrong word for everybody
who's not familiar with that idea is
very similar to the ring ward in that
it's a big thing you build around the
sun
but whereas the ringworld produces
gravity by spinning around very quickly
same as in your near cylinder uh it just
spins around the sun
um and that requires insanely high
tensile strength beyond anything we
could potentially make
the wrong world goes much cheaper on the
internet it basically is just
a whole bunch of cylinders in a tight
orbit uh position you know like
the like a long ladder that you wrapped
around the sun and they're spinning
around their own axis just normally but
you can go around that
tube that connected as the rug board um
that is one of the ways to make really
big interconnected structures that have
gravity individually
and uh in fact you can put gravity
inside the spinning rung
ladder edges as well if you want um
i do think that would be probably the
primary one used for habitation
large ones because that lets you stitch
so many of them together
but there is such an investment of
connection on that you know even a small
wrong wall that's only taking up me you
know a couple hundred miles of up and
down distance
uh that's still gonna have a population
of quadrillions on it who all have to
live in a unified whole that has to be
content with each other so
and you start getting the bigger runways
like you're it on the kendrick cylinder
you're now talking about something that
would have a
trillion people on it and they all have
to agree to there's some sort of
standard there whereas
with a normal dice now you really have
to agree to is orbital clearance
the next question is from james smith is
a civilization that expands on an
interstellar level
an ex existential yes an existential
risk to itself
in the same way that independent
colonies broke away from one another
i think so uh and that is one of your
fermi paradox solutions that's a late
filter for why you don't have
big expansion uh depending on your
attitude type of government you might
say well look
um we can't realistically govern alpha
centauri or or you know
yolani that black telepsalon iodine et
cetera
we can't um tau seti and epsilon iodine
anyway we can't govern these star
systems that are 10 20 light years away
from us
and we might be able to get resources
from them for a while but we don't
really have too much to trade them
maybe we can send them information and
they'll send us raw materials but we
don't really need them in any useful way
and they could become a threat to us and
especially if you're colonizing our
sphere all around you um you could
potentially be seeing yourself with
you know donald colonies who could choke
you off they could just prevent anyone
from getting to you from
more distant colonies
and uh it kind of depends on your
outlook on life and governance if you
had have reason to think that people who
escaped your rule did not want to uh be
friendly with you
you might be very unlikely to want to
create such colonies as to be in a much
better condition to escape your rule
so again it mostly depends on the
civilization and it isn't necessarily
automatically a tyrannic despotism
either
you might as we discussed in some of the
machine rebellion type episodes
just be so worried that you couldn't
maintain control over dangerous
technologies on some
distant and then very independent and
sparsely populated colony war that you
might say it's just too risky
and so you really don't make use of of
expansion colonially because it turns
out to be too much of a hassle or
concern especially if you're worried
you're going to see the enemies out
there
we have a question from don juan what's
your opinion on neutral link
starlink and the potential combination
of the two
um if if there's a neutral link i'm not
sure of it i've seen
you might mean neuralink but neurolink
and starlink wouldn't really seem like
they'd be in combination either so if
there's something called neutral ink i'm
not familiar with it and someone's gonna
have to have to let me know what that is
uh starlink is more about astronomy and
neurolink is more about
brain augmentation i can see how you
might combine the two but they won't
seem like natural uh
natural combinations or any space based
in uh internet for the same matter it's
obviously nice to be able to do
better internet but there's nothing
really changing your architecture
between whether it's orbiting
space or it's down on the ground we have
a question from moses
pippinger you often talk about
dismantling the solar system but what
about preservation of the beauty
of bodies like jupiter and saturn will
they become
universal parks possibly um
in the end the sun's got more mass than
than the whole
sourcing together ninety nine point
eight percent right uh
two every thousand atoms is not part of
the sun
in the solar system and yet there are
billions of other stars and planets out
there in the galaxy that we might decide
are more fun to take part
the thing i want to ask you is uh when
was the last time you looked at jupiter
to which the answer is never you need a
pair of binoculars or a telescope to see
it as anything more than a dot
right um the great red spot is bigger
than earth you might say where we should
preserve the great red spot
well the amount of gas and matter that's
inside there could easily support
quadrillions of people so then the
question becomes and this is
obviously a subjective answer you can't
really say at what point in time
does this very nice looking thing uh
that is not alive uh become viewed as
less valuable
than the potential that support
potentially billions of people
or trillions of people or in the case of
something like jupiter
quintillions of people and that just
depends on your civilization's outlook
and capability and i suspect that would
change over time
the thing is since you can make the
argument for me those you know there's
not really an absolute right or wrong
if you're talking about millions of
years going by views will change
and you know if this year people say no
we have to keep jupiter and next year
they say no we have to keep jupiter
do they still say no 500 years now 500
000 years from now
did they say no every year because the
moment they don't say no
that one time then the thing is going to
be used
and they can change their mind later on
but they ain't likely to put it back
together again
so i don't think we'd be very likely to
preserve planets uh
now earth is a bit of a different story
or if there's not a planet or if there's
the center of a civilization or birth
world
that's a very different kind of premise
there so
i think you could see earth getting
preserved maybe an early mars or moon
base because it might be well
established if we ever got to that point
but i don't think you see that applying
to all the gas giants i certainly don't
think would apply to all the other
plants in the galaxy
there are billions of times more stuff
than our source system has around it for
us to grab
so we might say yes preserve the entire
solar system but we're going to eat the
whole galaxy
i think you're kind of jumping into the
next question from james smith could we
ever view star lifting as unecological
in the same way we view expand
expending natural resources on earth in
the modern era
um well mind you we never consider
expanding
resources on earth on ecological we
speak of a specific way in which we do
it to be that
right um rarers for instance common
misconception that rare earths are rare
they are absolutely not real they are
all over the place
uh you can mine them anywhere you want
and profitably
so long as you don't mind doing it very
unecologically and of course one of the
things that's produced when you're
mining rare earths is
thorium tellings radioactive thorium
tellings and uh if you're in a thorium
based economy you might decide that
that's perfectly fine and useful and not
unecological anymore
your technology control is what's
ecological certain methods control
that's unecological
um there is no ecology off our planet
though star lifting
you know the only thing the sun gives us
you can make an argument for solar wind
and radiation to some degree
but what the sun gives us is light um
and then
light has no providence if you're doing
it with a giant lamps the same spectrum
is the same thing
i don't think there's any nature to
resolve on the sun
so people might have different views but
i can't see it just translating over as
easily because
we have forests we have parks here for a
reason they're interesting beautiful
things well the sun is beautiful too but
it's not alive
there's nothing to preserve there
ecologically it's a big hot burning mass
that's what's pretty about it
star lifting doesn't change that it
actually maybe just makes a little bit
harder
zelkotovic says hi isaac greetings from
serbia
i have a question what do you think of
using a huge railgun to launch
interstellar probes i think it's a great
idea um
problem with a huge railgun is you have
to have a huge long grail barrel
and um that's one of the reasons why
laser propulsion light sales is probably
preferable
but you could actually do that you know
with a railgun too the question with
anything involving rail is
what are you using as the actual rail
because you can't have things touching
at a very high velocities
and what are you using is the propellant
it's electricity or you're shoving it
there with a gas propellant or
electromagnetically or you're just
pushing it with a light beam
i don't think that you would bother in
most cases to actually have the long
rail pass maybe a few thousand
kilometers of your initial push
you're probably trying to be more
efficient to get up to several
kilometers a second but after that
have to expand the sail out and just
push it from behind the laser beam
you know that just seems easier or a
particle beam and a combination of two
so i don't think you'd use it for
interstellar probes other than as kind
of a quick jump start like we often see
with uh
short runways on aircraft carriers
jonathan says which scientific
inaccuracy annoys you the most when you
see it in sci-fi
scale um which is a pretty big
one there's always things that sci-fi
lothors have no sense of scale
um what gets me is you have these
empires that uh you know like the star
trek federation
i think they got a little bit better
about now these they have better special
effects but they used to have like 40
ships
in the starfleet of hundreds of worlds
and they have
antimatter engines and fusion and uh
really advanced computers and they can
only build 40 ships
and they only see the population like a
billion people per planet even though
they
can literally replicate food out of
nothing
that's the kind of was not paying
attention to the
implications of the technology when we
did it you know scale
is always the mistake sci-fi athletes
make the biggest one in terms of science
they always make you know i don't get
bothered by artificial gravity that's
conceit to filming i don't get bothered
by them not walking around with helmets
on because
you can't see the actors faces and most
of them act
you know very expressively so you take
that off as a concession you know
it's we say a suspension of disbelief
it's a reasonable break with reality
i don't mind that there are noises when
they are they're doing uh space battles
because it is the game that's there for
the audience
um i would not even be surprised if
ships had a tendency to make a little
boom or
explosive noises to to just help people
keep track of what's going on it's odd
to what you know face
same as they might zoom up so they have
a ship like one kilometer away from them
they're shooting at even though it's
actually
a million kilometers away just because
it might be easier for the mine to
handle
um but i'd say that is ultimately the
big one
scale we'd like to thank super chat
siddharth and he has a question top five
industries or technologies according to
you that will revolutionize the world by
2050
and thank you for the amazing videos
thank you um
top five technologies by 2050. uh yeah
we actually did a video on that
uh was with kapowski at the time they
they were going and asking what's a
futurist what they are what their big
technological 2050 and i decided to go
ahead and do that
um let's see uh
clanking self-replicators i think inside
the next uh
next 20 years we'd probably get a
clanking self-advocato
and then um
really good voice interfaces for
computer technology in terms of
interfaces and ai
um cheap reliable energy efficient power
whether it's it's ground-based solar
space based solar fusion
people finally say hey we're okay with
fission uh just way better battery does
that mean we can use any power source
and store it better
something like that um better automation
production
uh and then distribution
uh it's so easy to feed about that so
much of what we do
like power uh better resistors in the
wires
half our power is wasted on lines half
our fuel is wasted moving stuff around
things like that better distribution
smarter distribution it works so
uh we'll take one more question before
we go to break light pause heard
how far away do you think we are from
having
vr interface with probe that we send to
other planets
and using vr to control the rovers and
exploration devices
line minutes i mean um
we could do a probe on the moon that was
being controlled by us but we've no
reason to set a humanoid probe so the vr
interface is a little bit less useful
um and then how far away from models
well
you can't do a virtual reality interface
from mars
to here because you've got 20 minute
light time four minutes i think it's the
best time you get
um maybe if you want to orbit around
mars or things like that you know do
your probe on venus while you were in
orbit and it was down on the scorching
ground virtually audio could be very
useful for probes but
not for probes from earth to there
except a very very limited sense
so that technology will come around and
may be very helpful on
the moon may be very helpful in the
bottom of the ocean or dangerous places
but it's not really good for
interstellar flowers no use for them
stellar pose but not very good for
interplanetary posey though
all right we'll go ahead and go to break
we'll be back in a few minutes
so we're taking a quick break if you
want to grab a drink and a snack
and it's also a good time to get more
questions into the chat for moderators
if you didn't already know there's a few
moderators who keep an eye on the chat
window
both for good questions to relay and
troll and robot hunting
as i can't juggle that and running the
production and answering your questions
all at the same time
though i do come back and watch the chat
afterwards
i can't actually reply to the chat once
the live stream is over though
so if i don't get asked your question
just paste in the comments below and i
usually get those answered the evening
or day after
livestream even juggling reading the
questions off when the mods relay them
to me was getting a bit tricky
and so now we have someone reading them
off to me which i think makes for a
better production but certainly makes it
easier for me to do
and if you didn't already know the
person reading the questions after the
moderators picked
is my wife sarah and she does double
duty as the director for the live stream
since she has a lot more live public
speaking experience than me
and is much better at it so is often
sending me hand cues like slow down
look at the camera and get on with it as
doing a live production with on-the-fly
answers to often complex questions tends
to take about my focus and concentration
i also mentioned our moderators and i
want to give them a quick thanks
especially alexander syndry long who
handles most the technical side of
getting those questions to me
and is also the principal administrator
of our discord server which like the
rest of the show's social media
is linked in the episode descriptions we
often used to do an after hour session
following the live stream over on the
voice chat on discord
and for those who used to go and were
wondering yes we will get back to doing
that before much longer
but i wanted to get the adaptation still
live stream that we've adopted since i
moved to the new studio handled before
adding that feature back in
we do have a lot of minor additions to
the channel that have been under works
or slow rollout
like only releasing the episodes without
ads or sponsors on our nebula streaming
service
and many of those new features got a bit
delayed by my wedding and setting into
the new household in studio
and i think a bit more appearances on
camera during the episode will be one of
those
i still get a bit surprised after 20
live streams a bunch of interviews and
having always had my photo up on social
media and even on screen way back in
episode 1
how often folks comment on being
surprised to see the man behind the
voice on the show
so popping on camera more often in the
episodes maybe to read off the schedule
and announcements
might be one of those things we start
doing at some point
speaking of the schedule if you missed
any of the summer 2020 episodes
on june 18th we had space place to look
at how crime and law enforcement might
change in the future
then we took a look at graphene the
super strong material that offers so
many potential new technologies and
devices and
structures like giant space habitats and
the week after that we had to look at
some of those content size
megastructures
you might be able to build with graphene
then we contemplated what life might be
like as a disembodied brain in a jar
before considering our destiny as
interplanetary species
or in part one the first steps to it
then we returned to the megastructural
series to ask how we could get all the
material
to build tons of continent-sized
megastructures in
let's dismantle the solar system and
lastly we had another look at the fermi
paradox
to ask if all the giant cosmic voids or
disappearing and flickering stars
might indicate giant and ancient
civilizations were already out there
long since become interplanetary and
even interstellar species
we're still not done with july though
and will be back thursday july
30th for a fun dip into science fiction
to contemplate the idea of
technobarbarians
folks living at a time of advanced
technology they no longer fully
understand
and primitive technology at the same
time and we'll ask how realistic and
possible that might actually be for the
future of humanity
that will take us into august and you
can see the upcoming episodes for august
on the screen during the live stream
popping up in the upper left hand corner
of the screen as a last note we're
closing in on the show's sixth
anniversary at the end of the summer
and our 250th regular episode not
including bonus episodes and extras
will also be our first episode of august
covering super conductivity
and i want to thank everyone for joining
us every week and whether this is your
first time watching or you go back to
the old days
whether you're a donor and a patron on
the show or just hit the like or share
button from time to time
thanks for helping make sfia the success
it is
and now back to the show and we're back
next question the next question is from
afn acapella
how far in the future would you guess
you'd have to be dropped to be
absolutely
unable to use anything i'm going to
assume that's in the context of how far
in the future would you have to be
before you just couldn't use any of the
technology and feel completely out of it
uh like if you drop a caveman in the
modern society can you do anything
um and of course there's kind of a time
element there how long
would you be useless the flip side of
that though is that
kind of the idea behind technology is to
make it simpler and easier to use
and a lot of children are pretty capable
of using technology when they're four or
five years old and while
kids heads are like sponges don't ever
buy the idea that kids learn faster than
adults it's what do they learn fast or
kids can pick up raw information fast or
data that kind of thing but
adults are usually better at sorting it
out so
you might find that you uh pop it in the
future and it only takes a couple weeks
get
really used to using technology on the
other hand
if you have life extension and you've
had massive augmentation everyone's
intelligence so everyone's walking
around smaller than einstein and living
for thousands of years
the technology might be really
complicated because it never caused them
to dumb it down because to them it's so
easy to just go ahead and uh you know
flip this switch that one there or this
one there it's so like 500 key sequence
once upon a 500 key sequence you know
that might be kind of case and that
could be within a century it could be
within a thousand years
so it just depends on how technology
goes
we have a super chat from plastic
pinocchio hi isaac do you think it's
likely that in far
future we will become a post-scarcity
and
anarcho-socialist society much like ian
banks
the culture okay for those of you don't
know the
cultural series by e m banks the late
great author
is kind of viewed as is a much more
high-tech version of the star trek
federation
they well let's see they only have one
law you can't break but you can't read
people's minds basically
um there's almost no way to actually
break laws there's a result of it
but it's a post-scarcity civilization so
i wouldn't like characterizes
anarcho-capitalist random
socialists because either one might
apply it's more of um
again post-scarcity civilizations where
if you can provide everybody everything
they want with the flip of a switch
that easily then you don't really need a
lot of
core production things and your your
basic concept of socialism is
control of the production resources i
don't know that you really have
anyone controlling those in the cultural
because anybody can get their hands on
a replicator a star trek style
replicator that's actually fairly
low-tech bi-culture standards
um but uh i don't
think that you'd have exactly a payload
to that because
that one is is used a lot of caulk tech
as we would say it's it's assuming
really high speed fast from light travel
it's assuming basically infant access to
energy
um we tend to take the attitude that a
post-scale series civilization the way
we define it in on this channel
is a decrease or absence of anxiety
over basic needs like i don't really
worry about where my next breath is
coming from where my next glass of water
is coming from
or really where my next meal is coming
from uh it's not a source of major
anxiety to me
and uh we would just keep kind of going
up maslow's iraqi of needs to things
like
i'm not worried about my you know any
number of other survival traits security
things like that
and that's usually how we define post
scarcity on the channel because in a
finite universe an energy conserving
universe you can't have the classic post
scarcity which is just a
infinite supply of everything plus you
have to have things like uh
you know there's a finite amount of
prestige only one person can be the
number one best seller of books that
year that kind of thing
so there is still scarcity in those
concepts we would say there is a
minimization
of anxiety about the access to resources
and that it is a justified uh decrease
in anxiety
as opposed to what we call a
post-discontent society which uh
configured that tone was coined by
matthew campbell again one of our
editors who asked a question earlier
post-discontent society is one where
it's not post-scarcity
but people aren't worried about where
things are coming from because we've got
them brainwashed or
hopped up on drugs or things like that
so post-scarcity
and post-discontent vary in that one is
a genuine decrease in in anxiety about
where your resources are coming from as
to when we would have something like
that
again depending on how you're defining
it i would say that we're kind of
already there except that we don't have
renewable resources
and it's kind of limited just a few
areas right now uh
even then often just to certain social
economic tiers um
i would say within 50 years if we get a
renewable source of power
that we can really rely on for a large
output and if we get
slightly better automation than we have
right now for production that would be
the point which will be post scarcity
and again there are levels of post
scarcity obviously
the next question is from vincent walden
rivera when do you think
life extension will happen um several
thousand years ago
life extension technology as you say
they are on an episode on life extension
or the science of aging
um there's a quote i like to steal from
abbey to gray that he said to me one
time
and i think that's what it says to other
people too but uh we were talking he
said the key thing to always convey to
people about life extension
is that all medicine is life extension
and this is the mistake a lot of people
make on this there are probably certain
medical advances
that would really increase lifespan but
for the most part
every little thing we do is increasing
lifespan there's not a switch to flip
that just makes people live forever
other than the use of something like
self-replicating nanobots that could
just repair everything
um when we talk about life extension
we're saying how much longer do people
live on average
and and is the quality of living going
up with that because we're talking about
extending life not simply extending
existence right
um if you are healthy if you're younger
and you're making to a longer age well
you only have to look at
photographs from the 1800s to see you
know this person there that looks like
they're 70 years old and turns out
they're 45
we live longer we live healthier on
average that keeps going up we did have
a small
down tick in it for the first time in a
long time last decade but uh
for the most part it's been going up
like the stock market mostly up so
oh life extension technology ole miss is
life-saving technology and i think we'll
see a very big increase in that in the
next century
lori asks what would change in near
future when we get
unlimited energy soon let's say we get
fusion reactors working today
we should always keep in mind that just
because you get a fusion reactor does
not mean that all energy is suddenly
free a big cost about chunk is employing
people
at the facility uh and um you know
having all those lines
and keeping all those lines in place uh
we were driving
into town the other day along the lake
here they had a bunch of
electric poles they were replacing with
new electric poles it was quite an
operation
and it's so easy to forget because
they're there all the time that those
are pretty expensive to build and
maintain
um the big difference is you no longer
have a fuel requirement
in terms of an expensive fuel now the
big change is exactly that even if your
fusion reactor cost you a little bit
more dollars per watt you still use it
because there is an
infinite supply of that fuel there is
enough deuterium
a little hydrogen of your hydrogen
fusion to run the power we have now for
longer than this planet should be around
so that's the change there is no
bottleneck on that fuel anymore because
there's such an abundant source
the next question is from a flip diff
flute cuddle
is pineapple a valid pizza topping you
know if you'd asked me
five or six years ago i said no uh but
uh
i've got a really into autism pieces
recently um so
we're down to the willows and we had uh
yeah um they make
some very good artisan pizzas at one of
the local wineries here
i was going to say if you didn't say yes
i was going to have to make you one with
pineapple
yeah okay so i forgot my wife likes
pineapple i've actually decided that
chicken and pineapple do you have a
place
on pizza um that that was quite uh
eventual for me because normally i was
of the opinion that you got pepperoni
sausage cheese and certain vegetables
and nothing else should be on a pizza
uh i've even opened myself with some of
the weirder ones that don't have tomato
sauce on them though i don't know if
they should really be called a pizza
anymore at that point so
yes pineapple belongs on pizzas not
anchovies though
there was no no reason for the answer
we'd ever be on a pizza
with sadism okay um
uh i'm sorry i mangled that name so
kodovic
says what do you think about the
interplanetary hydrogen ram
engine um i'm kind of assuming you're
talking about abuse or amchet or
something similar there
and if that's the case otherwise uh
please send me a note to that afterwards
so if
someone's got new interstellar ram
engine design the abuse of ramjet
uh was the idea that if you're running
on fusion fuel
you should be able to get a certain
amount of energy out of whatever things
you come across in
space to just keep sucking them in and
using them as you know your fusion
source to push around
there's two problems that first the
actual method doesn't look like it turns
out to be energy varying for how they
were doing it
but you could still use a fusion reactor
if you had one to do this the thing is
you cannot go
faster with that ship with the fusion
reactor then the amount of kinetic
energy a particle hitting you would have
compared to how much it would release
that's where you
hit your drag point have to stop
speeding up so
in the case of fusion reactor we usually
say you get uh call it that you're
getting point one percent of the end
well
say degeneracy one percent of the energy
one percent of the mass energy is gonna
let you get the temperature of light
speed
uh and that's the point in which you'd
be hitting particles maybe giving you
just as much energy as you're you have
fusing them
you go down to point zero one percent um
which would be
fission levels so like if you run across
uranium atoms
and you're going to be at one percent
speed of light so that can actually
function
um now you could do that with a black
hole for instance too
especially if you've got a way of
manipulating dark matter is cheap fuel
um because those tend to run more like
40 percent of matter energy conversion
then you're starting to talk about
something
like money at
50 percent of light speed there don't
don't trust that number real quick but a
much better interstellar speed
um the abuse of ramjet itself though it
had problems with how it was designed to
run which was basically ramming the
things
at interstellar speeds into the fusion
reactor to set the fusion off
so that model doesn't look like it works
very well uh to speed ships up quite the
contrary it looks like it slows them
down
however that could be handy too because
you need as much fuel to slow down as to
speed up
breaking in space is not free so if
you've got abuse with ramjet and it oh
it does slow you down you turn on
that's actually useful so okay we have a
thought chat
or a super chat from thought criminals
what do you think of david pierce
and the idea of wire heading should we
turn everything in our light cone
into hedonium um
that's familial but i'm worried i'm
going to mangle it trying to answer it
i'm going to guess hedonium
is something similar to computronium but
maybe that's
matter based on the idea of converting
all matter into something designed to
give
happiness or pleasure uh if that's the
case then i don't know
i guess that would be uh up to the
individual and i could be completely
misreading that question
um but uh yeah that's what they said i
can give you as an answer on that one
yeah if someone please message me a link
about that afterwards i'll give you a
better answer
cyber says do you think sky hooks are
the future of cheap space
travel if not what do you think would be
the technology that revolutionizes space
travel it all depends on what comes up
as easiest but
uh i think skyhooks have a role in it
i think that electrodynamically
tethering ones that can regenerate their
momentum between
hooks is probably your best one and so
that would only really be useful on
plants that large magnetospheres
whereas other types of sky hooks might
be very useful um
around plants don't have atmospheric
magnesium
since you could just hook it right down
against the planet and grab thing off
the ground
um i don't think it's going to be as big
a one if you'd asked me
five years ago i'd have said yes because
a sky hook plus a hypersonic plane an
air breather
like a scramjet that's space travel
right there
but we've had so much improvements with
reusable rockets of late that i'm not
sure there will ever be a period where
it was particularly handy
we might just go from using reusable
rockets to something really big like a
mass driver or an orbital ring
so we have another super chat from
morton vanvic
isn't our ability to see what's
happening outside our solar system very
narrow
since we're seeing back in time
andromedia x is two and a half
million light years away so we have no
idea what happened there in the last two
and a half million years
the andromeda galaxy is two some million
light years away
uh and will collide with us about three
billion um we don't know what's going on
there today
we don't know what's going on at mars
you know uh 10 minutes ago it has got to
a shed
uh astronomy is history however history
is very long
uh you know we're saying drama is two
million light years away and that's on
the assumption the universe is 13.7
billion years old
2.5 million divided by 13.7 billion
is what like one five thousand so
we're missing a little bit of the time
there but not that bigger one the grand
scheme of things
um the further away you get the
you know the more back in time you are
but again if you double the distance
you're doubling time backwards you all
but you're adding eight times as much to
cubed as much
value of things to look at so you can
actually statistically sample things
like civilizations out that way
but in our galaxy everything's within a
hundred thousand years
you know and uh that's a long time for
civilization
but against the estimated age of the
universe that's nothing and against the
estimated age of this planet
uh you know that's nothing so i don't
think it really prevents us but it is
a hard ball and be a look at coin events
as war
zouzian asks how big do you think
factories will get in the early stages
of established interplanetary
civilization do you think moon sized
phone factories might pop up
yes um you know there's a tendency we
have in the computer you know saying
that uh miniaturization is the way that
everything's gonna keep getting smaller
and smaller
and to some degree that's true although
people seem to ignore that while we said
that we've actually gotten bigger and
bigger factories at the same time
they're just miniaturized while also
getting bigger uh to me bigger is always
better
except for when it's not but usually
bigger is better and
uh i could actually see solar system
size factories if it came down to it you
might decide that you want to produce an
awful lot of uh
well we've got an episode coming up on
phosphorus and the rarity of phosphorus
in about a
month and a half or so and uh one thing
we talked about there is a way you might
get around that is to mass produce the
stuff
and of course how do you mass produce
phosphorus well make it out of silicon
by blowing stars up but you make it out
of silicon by neon neutrons probably
so you might decide you're going to
create a solar factory a big stellar
engine is that of
the uh you know metal conversion type
if you're doing that typically with
things like fusion your efficiency goes
way up the bigger you go
a lot of things are like that so
miniaturization handy and some things
minimizations always be better for
but huge can also have an advantage too
quantity has equality all its own
arturo renato bb says what do you think
of bio
molecular organic engineering of
spacecraft and other structures
not excluding megastructures such as
dyson swarms
void ecology um last year we did an
episode called void ecology
and the accompanying episode space
whales
and there we looked at the idea that you
might start
if not actually creating organisms that
were designed to live in the void
um engineering things that were
effectively life forms
uh you know not carbon based and a
couple months ago we looked at
non-carbon-based life and we said we
didn't think it was too likely to occur
naturally but you could make it um you
know all you need is a self-replicating
process of some sort
and that does not require what we'd say
carbon and water and
phosphorus and some other things you
could do it differently and i think you
might find that that organic approach
that ecological approach might be easier
than a straight engineering approach to
really big scale engineering projects so
i think you could easily see
creating something equivalent to big
organic solar panels around the sun that
were part of a food chain that delivered
power energy and
matter of production two places we have
a super chat from
louise mora do you believe dark energy
could be just the universe expanding in
other dimensions
and then making gravity work differently
through time
um
there is a notion that the reason why
gravity is the weakest force
uh so much weaker than the others is
because it's spreading itself across
multiple dimensions and that's a very
core idea to
most versions of string theory and brain
theory which is pretty similar
m theory um you know we look at the
electromagnetic force the strong nuclear
force and the weak nuclear force and it
goes
strong force and then like a little bit
we call nuclear force
electromagnetic force and then way way
way down they are billions of billions
of billions of times weaker
is the gravitational force whereas the
others are within about 100 of each
other
um could it be spending itself across
and your infinite number
of parallel realities alternate
dimensions things like that
if that is the case uh and if it is
keyed into dark energy which
gravity and dark energy symmetry could
easily be related in some fashion
and of course has a mysterious origin of
coming from who knows where
you know uh dark energy say outright is
a violation of consummation energy but
we've known that
conservative energy was violated the uh
cosmic scale since uh einstein's theory
of general relativity
um not locally which is what the key
thing is so it could be connected but
the question is how do you prove it and
we really don't have the ability to do
any experiments
right now that would prove almost
anything involving dark energy let alone
parallel realities we have several
questions
here also super chats from thought
criminal the first
is isaac what do you think are the odds
that ai alignment problem will be
successful
also have you read eliza yadkowski's
sequences um
some of you probably recognize eliza
yukowski from les wrong and he is the
one who came up with but well actually i
don't know if he came up with it but
uh the paper clip maximized was an
example of that and the roku's basket
let's go things that most from less
round
um vocal's best was the idea that you
might have an ai that
weakly violates causality by
basically telling everybody that if you
don't help it out it's going to torture
you
it's going to resurrect you and torture
you when you uh when it comes to
existence so
you have to work to help the ai come
into existence in the first place
um which is a very strange thought
exercise but that's what goes back
let's look it up um i don't really know
it's i've not read some of his more
recent stuff so i don't want to
speculate too much on it but
usually we're talking about trying to
get ai into some sort of tight zone
where it interacts with humans
in what we think of as a human-ish
psychology
um there's a lot of debate about
self-loathing ones if they ever do that
i tend to think that they would because
to me there's only
three ways you make an ai you either
program it from scratch in which case
it's exactly what you want to be
you copy it from a template we had a
human mind or an animal mind you stop
there and just tweak it a little bit in
which case
very close to your human mind or it's
self-learning
well if it's self-learning how much
self-learning is it are you plugging
into your databases do you give
wikipedia say okay there you go
why would it think like a human well all
the information is guinea is
from human sources from human narrative
and perspective so
there's no guarantee that it would end
up as a human that way but i think it's
a lot better than random with odds like
that so
okay and the following question was what
do you think of open individualism
such as the idea that we are all one
consciousness
experience in itself subjectively
also are you familiar with daniel kolack
and andre gomez emilson
um the i've heard that idea expressed
before and the one that comes to mind is
uh ambassador deland from babylon 5
that that was with the member he thought
great show by the way
uh was that uh the universe was uh or us
we or the universe experiencing itself
i don't tend to like ideas like that um
but uh because they're not really what i
think of as being philosophically or
theologically kind of get grounded they
give a bit of circular arguments
involved sometimes but
yeah you know it's possibility i suppose
and not when i really think of as uh
provable so the next super chat question
is from plastic pinocchio could the
average person born in a western country
in the year 2000
lived to be 150 to 200 years old
considering near
mid-term life extension technology i
hope so
um every so often people ask me what
technology i most want to get invented
during my lifetime and i always say life
extension
i think that people who are born since
this millennium began
will probably live to see a period of
time where
people do not die in their double digits
and maybe just don't die from old age at
all you get the kind what we call a
takeoff speed right
at what point are you speeding up the
improvement of life extension
so fast that you're going you know
you're adding a year of life on
faster than people experience a year of
life um i think we could be getting to
that place right now it's about one
every six years
every six years has passed by the last
century the average lifespan has gone up
by about a year that's been the rough
average
um we need to get some more like one to
one if we
take off speed but you know if it just
goes to say two to one you know at that
point you've lived an extra century and
that's 50 more years you get to
experience the result of that so i think
that we all get to the point where
that's
probably true i think people who are
born this millennia
will not die of old age during this
century
we have another super chat from brian
justice love the channel what are your
thoughts on the new york times story
about the government potentially
releasing info about another world ship
if it's true then how would your world
and scientific views change
um you know this comes up a lot of times
with evidence of this or that
uh ufo i'm going to say something that
occasionally comes by with this
most the ufo conspiracy stuff revolves
around people saying they don't trust
the government as a source of
information
why would you suddenly then trust them
if they were saying they might have
found something
um but you know the evidence is not
it doesn't matter the government says it
does not it doesn't matter if an air
force pilot says that you're not
pilots are not any more reliable so
force than anybody else just very
confident about it
show me it in the lab show me pictures i
can take apart lab and say that is
exactly what that is
that's when it crosses the line into
scientifically approvable
before that if you believe it you
believe it it's not that big a deal you
know
maybe you think that they're visiting us
maybe you don't proof though scientific
proof is a different level
and that's the context that i'm
commenting to you guys from so that's
the standard i'm hoarding to
we have a couple more super chats here
um one from dragonborn
hey isaac i'm curious what do you
believe will be the motivation for the
first
interstellar colonies will it be a
collaborative effort or will it be
motivated by a dislike of their home
cultures
that is hard to say uh i'm gonna go
ahead and say that the first one
probably will be a big collaborative
effort because it's that first one
you know uh it might be one nation or
group that's pushing for it but that
would be the big drive for the first new
stellar colony
will be to be the first people to plant
a flag on the planet
after that especially if it's in later
in solo development where you already
have you know thousands of off-world
bases in our solar system
i think that's going to start being more
individual groups decide they want to
leave
to be separate from our cultural not
necessarily in a hostile fashion they
just want
the opportunity the breathing room the
second sons kind of thing
all right and a super chat from andre
jones do you think the answer to the
fermi
fermi paradox is that the universe is
filled with mostly microbial life
i kind of hope so because i would hate
to think that life is that that rare
thing in some ways but at the same time
um i don't like to speculate too much on
that my hunch is that we're going to
find a lot more life out there
um but very simple life but it might
turn out that's very barren too
we don't know we're good we have to
check you know that's the biggest thing
with before we paradox
we only know about not even
civilizations like ourselves we only
know about the absence of highly
advanced civilizations
more advanced than us more older than us
who also use
our basic approach to universe that's
the ones we could say don't around so
i'm going to take one or two more
questions in color today all right we
have a question here from melancholy
with a fully automated economy where
more people don't equal more stuff
what incentives would people have to
have a higher population when more
people just mean
less resources for each person um
you know there's a great book by robert
zubin who you probably know from the
case of mars called motions of despair
that are finally recommended to me
and he kind of talks about this idea if
you finite resources there does get to
be a point where it becomes a bit of a
zero-sum game to divide those around but
you have to remember what is a resource
you know we live on productivity that's
mostly productivity other people
by and large we've gotten more people
our productivity per person has gone up
as has our standard of living
there is presumably a hard maximum of
that somewhere but i don't think we need
to be
putting into the equation right now i
think that right now more people
in general if it's slow both is to open
a bid
cole nell asks what could be the next
step for computers
other than quantum negative energy
computers and parallel dimensions for
space
or something else ideally computers that
are capable of
creating the next generation of
computers ones that could actually help
you design the next generation
um i think that we just inside of known
physics quantum computing is probably
the only one that's going to really
break with the main system though
all right uh we got time for another
question okay
hapzidi tied midiwat says
i'm world building a sentinel alien race
that has
medieval technology but i want them to
be as realistic as possible have you got
any tips
uh when world building i tend to suggest
uh looking at sanderson's laws of magic
uh he's uh brandon sanderson a great
writer for fantasy
and some sci-fi too uh helps out a lot
of folks in terms of writing what
they're just the general approach of
trying to make it feel realistic
even when it's fantastic and a lot of
that is don't ever let it turn into a
deuce ex machina
you have to have a reason why they have
that technology blend that
techno-primism blend and actually that's
our episode coming up this uh this
thursday is technical barbarians so we
will talk about that a bit more there
one more question we'll call it quits
okay uh the next one here is megazolsti
how do you think humans and human
civilizations will look like in 100 000
or more years if we don't turn ourselves
into
cyborgs or digital code in a big
computer
i think if you've gone that route you've
probably decided you want to be pretty
stationary with your existence in which
so you might tend to see a lot of
vintage cultural around you'd probably
see
all sorts of different ones but you
might have a certain intensity towards
intentional stagnation of culture at
that point in time just because
you've chosen not to you know personally
whether it's your chunk of the
civilization or the entire civilization
you have decided to upload yourselves or
put a computer ship in your head et
cetera
but otherwise i don't think pretty much
same trends we have now you would see as
cultures diversified as they spread out
and
and uh experience more time and place
all right we're gonna go ahead and uh
quits for today thank you so much for
joining us and we will see you thursday
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your question
feel free to post as a comment below and
i'll try to get to it this evening
also you can continue the conversation
at any of the forums on facebook
reddit discord or our website
isaacarthur.net
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
thursday
