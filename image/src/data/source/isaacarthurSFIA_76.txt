One advantage Mars has over The Moon or Venus 
is that it already has a decent amount of water  
frozen at its poles that we could use for early 
settlement projects. It’s nowhere near enough for  
true terraforming efforts, and Mars is also low on 
nitrogen, which is what makes up most of our air,  
so we turn our eyes deep out to Kuiper Belt 
and beyond, where the comets come from,  
and there’s enough frozen water and nitrogen 
out there to fill many hundreds of seas and  
skies. As we saw in our episode Comet Mining, 
those icy bodies can be moved in as artificial  
comets and dropped upon Mars, but it will be 
no easy process. A mountain sized icy body  
like Halley’s Comet is only 220 gigatons, 
while the mass of Earth’s ocean is over a  
billion gigatons. It can be done but we would 
need over a million such comets, and it would  
require multiple centuries of constant heavy rain 
planet-wide from melted comets to fill those seas.
