BWC Megastructure
BWC or “Because We Can” Megastructures,  
is a nickname for those types of hypothetical 
megastructures which are interesting as concepts  
but wildly impractical enough that we would 
only expect them to be built for prestige or  
tourist value. Though in a system of potentially 
millions of more normal habitats and worlds,  
such rare oddities might be built 
economically for their novelty value.
 
Examples include Donut Planets, Chain Worlds, 
Sombrero Planets, Cube-Shaped Planets, or Flat  
Earths. It should be noted that sometimes a BWC 
can have specialized values as, for instance,  
a coin-shaped world allows identical 
seasons, temperature, and weather at  
all points, ideal for a beach resort planet, 
something a classic spherical planet lacks,  
with frozen wastes at the poles. What qualifies 
as a BWC Megastructure is somewhat subjective.
 
For more examples of these type of Megastructures,  
along with more practical designs, see 
our episode, the Megastructure Compendium.
