An idiocracy, deriving its name from a 2006
comedy film, is a type of government or civilization
whose de facto leadership and citizenry are
incompetent and stupid, and possibly saturated
with virtual reality or openly encourage substance
abuse.
While such civilizations would seem incredibly
short-lived, there is a concern that sufficiently
advanced technologies and post-scarcity civilizations
might have so little selection pressure for
intelligence and good judgment that after
many centuries they devolve into these and
be able to remain functioning indefinitely.
Governments run by AI might find caring for
their citizens easier if they were in such
a state too.
Or people might bifurcate into a more impulsive
or less intelligent primary population and
a second smaller cousin species of those possessing
those traits who ruled openly or from behind
these scenes, over their cousins.

& C.H.U.D.s for more discussion of this topic.
