We often cite being hit by lightning or winning 
the lottery as unlikely, but when it comes to  
improbable ways to die, being hit by a meteorite 
is even less likely. While lighting and lottos  
might be one in a million odds for a person, 
that’s roughly how many meteorites hit Earth  
during a human lifetime. 70% of those fall 
right in the oceans, and most of the Earth’s  
surface is uninhabited, only a millionth of 
Earth's surface actually contains a human. 
You’d probably need a million meteors to fall 
and survive to hit the Earth’s surface to take  
out a single person, though they might come in 
at a sharp angle or have a bit of blast radius,  
depending on size. Size does matter here too, 
most meteors reach Earth at about the size of a  
pebble and hit at a few hundred miles per hour, 
so getting hit by one is comparable to a bullet  
and thus not instantly or definitely fatal. Exact 
odds are hard to say, but for an individual person  
in their whole lifetime being fatally hit by 
a meteorite are less than one in a trillion.
