Nuclear bombs are such potent weapons that it 
would seem absurd to use them as a component of  
another weapon system, but it is very likely that 
ICBMs and even covert nuclear strikes by smuggling  
warheads into an area will be rendered obsolete 
by superior Ballistic Missile Defense systems  
and radiation detectors. As fast as an ICBM is, 
striking anywhere in a fraction of an hour, in a  
digital era, reaction times can be reduced to mere 
moments. However, you can use a nuclear bomb like  
a power source or gunpowder to run a giant laser 
or gun, like we see with Project Excalibur or the  
lesser known Casaba-Howitzer. A small atomic bomb 
can shove on a pusher-plate like a piston in an  
Orion Drive spaceship. But it can also be used to 
shove a very large bullet or power up a single-use  
laser or other electrically driven device.
it would be handy if you have to fight giant  
Kaiju or Cthulhu, but Project Excalibur was 
intended to be used to blow up incoming ICBMs,  
and it could be modified to help clear 
orbital space debris or take out asteroids.
