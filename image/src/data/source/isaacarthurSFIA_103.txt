We often worry that Earth might warm up and  
our polar ice caps could recede or melt entirely, 
and indeed even without our help that will happen  
one day as the Sun steadily grows hotter and in 
perhaps a billion years would strip off our seas  
and sky. But it was also cooler in the past, 
for the same reason, and one problem with ice  
is that once it’s there it is white and shiny 
and reflects much sunlight back out into space,  
rather than absorbing its warmth.
It is possible for a planet like  
ours to begin freezing and grow colder as that 
ice marches from the poles toward the equator,  
reflecting even more light back into space. This 
may have happened to Earth not too long before  
life first crawled out of the oceans, and possibly 
several times. Thankfully our volcanic eruptions  
would have painted the surface with sun-absorptive 
ash to eventually to thaw us out, but this may be  
why life is rare in the Universe, few planets are 
habitable, and many don’t stay that way for long.
