In the last few decades we have found more and 
more exoplanets and this is very exciting but  
it does seem like every few months someone 
declares we might have found a planet like  
Earth and these are usually planets less 
Earthlike than Mars, though on the larger  
or hotter side. It is vastly easier to spot large 
planets like Jupiter or those close to their star,  
and so most of what we detect is very big or very 
hot or both. And none of these are habitable. 
 
Super-Earths are particularly prone to getting 
labeled Earth-like and I’ve seen planets nearly  
as big as Neptune called ‘earth-like’, but we’ve 
only found a handful of planets of a similar mass  
to Earth and these are around red-dwarf stars, 
which have some issues with habitability we  
explored in our episode Colonizing Red Dwarfs. We 
don’t think Earth-sized planets in the goldilocks  
or habitable zones are uncommon,just hard to 
see currently, but that time is changing and  
soon we may find some truly Earth-like worlds we 
may visit, settle, or find indigenous life on.
