A Fusion Candle is a type of hypothetical
Megastructure that is an enormous fusion drive
that is placed in orbit of a gas giant, like
Jupiter.
The FusionCandle is designed to suck hydrogen,
deuterium, or even helium out of the atmosphere,
run it through a fusion reaction, and use
the energy released to send out two super-heated
rocket jets in opposite directions, up and
down.
The lower levitates the platform while the
higher goes into space to shove the planet
in a desired direction.
By this method, you can move a gas giant to
a different location, such as if you wanted
to move one closer into a system to warm its
moons for terraforming.
See our episode: Colonizing Jupiter, for more
discussion, or our Megastructure Compendium,
for more examples of Megastructures like the
Fusion Candle.
