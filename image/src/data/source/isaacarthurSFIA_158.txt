Building Artificial Planets
We often talk about building enormous space  
habitats for people to live in as alternatives to 
trying to terraform planets like Mars or Venus to  
somehow make them livable, and yet as cool as big 
cylinder or ring habitats is, for a lot of folks  
a planet like Earth is going to be preferable. 
And you can potentially build a planet just like  
Earth. Our usual assumption is that you would skip 
on using rare materials like iron and uranium in  
the core in favor of very abundant materials 
like hydrogen or helium or even dark matter or  
black holes, and thus be able to build a lot more 
Earth-sized planets with a lot less rocky matter. 
And yet artificial planets identical to 
earth isn’t your only option, you can build  
ones very like Earth in climate and gravity 
but a hundred times larger in surface area,  
or even millions of times bigger than Earth, 
as we explored in our episode MegaEarths,  
where you might have a planet that is orbited 
by a star, has a black hole in its center,  
and has a surface so big that it has entire 
archipelagos of large continents on it.
