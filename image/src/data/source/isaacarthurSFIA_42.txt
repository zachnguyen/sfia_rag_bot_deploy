Terms like planet and star, moon and asteroid, 
and even gas giant or rocky planet, all date  
back to times when we understood a lot less about 
what the universe looked like and often represent  
somewhat arbitrary designations that later needed 
revision or fill-ins and the brown dwarf is one  
example of that, and indeed they were originally 
called black dwarfs but the term was already in  
use for cold white dwarfs, which are dead stars, 
and brown dwarfs are bodies that never got big  
enough to be stars, sub-stellar objects. In color 
they would not be brown but gray, black, or very  
dim red. They range in mass all the way up to 90 
Jupiters but are all about the size of Jupiter,  
and we put the cutoff to gas giant planet at 13 
Jupiter Masses as deuterium fusion can occur here,  
and we now have stellar classes L, T, and Y, 
as discussed in our stellar compendium episode,  
for further and better defining types 
of brown dwarf sub-stellar objects.
