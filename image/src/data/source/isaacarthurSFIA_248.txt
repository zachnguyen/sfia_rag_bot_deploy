mouth township ohio isaac welcome thank
you
well thank you everybody for attending
today thank you so much for that
introduction and
for those of you who don't really know
the show too much i have the distinctive
honor of getting to talk about all the
really high-tech futuristic topics that
everybody loves me to talk about that we
won't get to build for centuries in some
cases maybe one or two centuries in
other cases
possibly means scientific notation of
how many centuries it's going to be so
we need to cover a wide variety of
topics from of course a favorite of this
group the onio cylinder
to more advanced topics that relate to
later on
things that we often classify merely as
a bwc megastructure or things that we'd
only build because we can like a
cubeshaped planet
so after about eight years of doing this
uh we were talking to what the original
topic for the show was it kind of got
started as a bit of an accident because
i had found that i kind of missed
working in physics after i got out of
physics in the army and so i was talking
about science fiction writers they're
trying to be more realistic about their
settings say how can we have something
besides just the classic old cliche
planet so you're missing a whole range
of these awesome cool megastructures
that would be a great setting for so
much your sci-fi and they're a lot more
realistic in so many ways so i threw
together a little powerpoint put a
narration over top of it put up on
youtube
and later on i got this email from
youtube saying you have a subscriber i
said what the heck is the subscriber
so uh what about eight years and seven
thousand subscribers later 100 million
views and uh more onto the platforms we
are here saying i thought what a great
chance to uh kind of redis that original
topic of megastructures today so i think
in this case most of my audience and
most of you do know what a megastructure
already is they are a little bit hard to
clearly define they are not merely a
thing in the future but you obviously
have seen in the past you say great
world china is one you could say that
the pyramids are one we say well we mean
megastructures in space but not entirely
just mega structures in space building
up on planet one state too
now
how you actually classify megastructures
is kind of tricky there are so many
different ways of doing it but for today
just for today we're going to be
dividing them into habitation big
structures space and energy sorry power
and energy bank structures
space travel megastructures weapons and
defense megastructures astronomy
communication megastructures and
computation maker structures however my
favorite of that is habitation
megastructures so while as this is
forced it's the last one to cover so we
have tons of time for it and then we'll
get to questions as we used you on these
live streams so for those who don't know
our format usually we do a weekly
episode on thursdays plus one science
fiction based episode once a month but
also once a month we do a live stream q
a as opposed to our usual pre-recorded
format and one things i like about uh
pre-recorded is i can use so much better
visuals for it and it's always a risk
with powerpoint i couldn't skip the
chance today to show some of the really
nice animations because there were so
few animations for so many of these
topics eight years ago and
since then i've got to work with so many
animators have commands to bring some
ease to visual life that we're going to
be kind of looking at some of them as we
go but we're going to start with one
that a lot of you already are familiar
with
power and mega power energy mega
structural space based solar power is
one of the big topics for this
conference today who here i just go
watch a couple of those uh talks on
space-based solar it's a topic that is
either controversial or wildly accepted
as a great thing for the future for my
part i usually say it's one of the two
big kick-starting technologies that
could really get some space the big way
either asteroid mining or
we always love technology by the year
2040 we'll manage to still have twice as
many audio visual glitches as we do
nowadays so the usual idea of course is
that you need these gigantic thin solar
panels or mirrors or shades sometimes
for direct power collection sometimes
for
just shading a planet or adding light to
it like we might do with mars to warm it
up
this whole range of power structures
power and energy whether it's beaming
energy down to earth whether it's
putting light onto mars or whether it's
being used to beam energy to places that
are beyond what we say good solar
locations or even in the case of space
travel to help push spaceships
so that's our next category is space
travel based ones and say well you got
mega structures for space travel some of
those are your power and energy based
ones that would help to push them some
of your space force your destinations
but the spaceships themselves will often
count as a megastructure just to move
that much ecology from one place to
another is usually going to acquire a
mega structural habitation all by itself
who here has heard of the book
rendezvous with rama
hopefully everybody who here recently
saw the new movie dune
yeah who here was really glad to know
that the director of dune is also the
one who's going to be directing to do
rendezvous with vomifer
yeah
so hopefully very good visuals for that
could be a hard one to do
so we have big ships like that that we
could be sending out into space
giant cylinder habitats that people
could live on for generations generation
ships or arc ships and of course we also
have the ability to push ships using the
power and energy bigger structures we
just looked at either using beamed
energy maybe direct lasers or just
sending them power so they can shoot
photons or not photons shoot various
particles out the back that have been
accelerated by that energy the ability
to break the rocket equation or at least
bend it a little bit by sending in your
power energy or even your propellant
from far away unless you actually
potentially do spaceships that might get
to
other star systems in less than
centuries so that is one of our examples
of what we want big structures for
sending power around on screen at the
moment we have the niko dyson beam
that's always a favorite it's a little
bit big for what you usually need
typically you use the nyquil dyson beam
which is the collection of panels around
a stall to send a beam of energy at some
location
that would be become a death star effect
you would blow a planet up if you use
the entire solar output of a star but
you could push a very big spaceship with
that or you could potentially push the
star system with that or you could use
much smaller ones or star lasers quota
based mirrors to push more modest
spaceships up to real fractions of speed
of light in that kind of context your
problems become how do i slow down
and how fast can i go without ramming
into things because you can break away
from the rocket equation from having
energy focused from far away you're just
not bound to in the same way it becomes
as good of yours
anti-matter so
now our next category of uh
megastructures
coming off the topic of gigantic beaming
energies that can blow up planets all
weapons and defense you could have some
very very big weapons and you probably
would need them for those kind of
combats that you might have going
between star systems and of course
we're not necessarily going to love the
idea of having giant weapons in space
but they're probably going to become a
rowdy so you probably want to have
defenses that could handle that as well
and so we look at the future we say we
want mostly to have peaceful uses
of
science peaceful use of technology but
we shouldn't force those i think there
won't be some pretty big weapons out
there
and of course that's another attractive
way to help develop space is you've got
potentially energy sector trillions of
dollars of economy they are potentially
communications but defense a big one too
it's been one of the ones pushing it
from the get-go we should expect to see
that still playing the war so weapons
defense another one of all types of
megastructure
often one of the cooler ones but at the
same time not necessarily my favorite
one we're gonna move through fairly
quickly today right
and then our next example we astronomy
and communication megastructures
how what is the biggest telescope right
now is anyone off top the head what the
largest telescope is
optical i think it's maybe it's the
binocular a or 10 meters there's some
other bigger ones up in space
and you have a very large array we want
to be able to put giant spaceships up
there science telescopes up there
because
there's no gravity there there's no wind
to form your lenses so you can build
really huge if you actually have the
ability to build up real big moon bases
you can build parabolic telescopes on
the moon
spinning liquid metal ones that can let
you build giant xenoblast with
telescopes to see
very very far away the dark side of the
moon may be very handy for that purpose
on top of that we also have the ability
to just do very large arrays of meals
very large collections of them very
large parallax not just earth's orbits
but potentially ones that are built out
in the oort cloud to connect to each
other and just give you that huge
parallax with things like that you might
actually be able to lens a planet like
we can our solar system even though it's
hundreds of light years away it's huge
it's big that's our topic for today is
not to feel like these ideas that we can
do right now
that we have these limitations on mass
are going to stay there forever when you
have industry in space when you have
full settlements up in space the entire
dynamic changes you have the ability to
just build things so enormously huge
that we wouldn't expect them there's
around a trillion solar systems in this
galaxy well half that maybe
trillions of planets what if each one of
them had a hubble telescope size thing
that was just devoted to it
seems ridiculous but if you're dealing
with a dyson swarm or a car scale
civilization that's what you might
actually have
in a civilization we have billions upon
billions of people living in space
then in that sort of snow you might have
a trillion astronomers how many
astronomers are in the united states
right now maybe a thousand
that's probably pretty close to one
million people if not more than
astronomers if there's a billion billion
that means you have a trillion
astronomers
you actually have the ability to
potentially build these giant telescopes
that can look at each individual star in
the galaxy
constantly one just devoted to that and
so we don't want to assume
that
one moment
always a gamble to put visuals inside
your powerpoints especially videos
technology hates you it's like space
everything about technology and
presentations much like space is
designed to kill you so
one of the things i love about the show
is i get to work with these really
awesome animators jeremy joswick did
this one
so often and it's the law i have to
bring them in i say this has never ever
ever been animated before this would be
the first thing you ever get to look at
who here has seen the high frontiers
book with charlie o'neill
i hope almost everybody right it's the
classic it's the one we grew up
listening and watching watching looking
at right the o'neill sono is that visual
display and we all think of that great
art by don s davis
and so for our animators they are the
ones who are getting to do
so many of those first things are going
to inspire future generations so that's
why i lure them in to help on the show
so
all right so astronomy always a big one
seti the social interaction extras your
intelligence which has a second
component
we don't just use giant telescopes to
find alien civilizations we also hope
that they've been building giant things
themselves and we go looking for that
dysonian city or other megastructural
based searches fresh terrestrials that's
one of the options there you build
bigger telescopes and you hope they also
build big ones too
but then we say what else can we do with
that well if you try to look through
signals try to include data you can
build some really big computers who
heroes
we use the telescopes to try to get the
answers to things like life the universe
and everything right
does everybody know the answer to life
the universe and everything else
40 42
so
we have in that story a
city-sized computer called deep thought
that comes up with an answer and the
advice it gives to it's it's it's
creators that gives them that answer is
build me a bigger computer i beg me a
planet-sized computer build me a planet
mind and say well we go even bigger than
that with megastructures a planet-sized
computer is big but you can go ahead and
create what we call a matrioscopy which
is an example of a dyson sphere now the
name comes from the classic nested
dollars of the matrioska uh dollars from
russia but the idea is that each
additional layer of it is going to be
giving out raised teeth it's just layout
layer of solar panel and computer each
layer is absorbed by the next layer and
one step down until you have gone down
to deep space where it's even more
efficient computation because it's
freezing cold
and you can do so much calculation with
that i think we worked out one time that
if uh if it does turn out that you need
about 10 to 16
flops i mean a human mind at real speed
that you could do something like 10 to
30 humans simultaneously on just one
g dwarf machioroscope that's a lot that
is more than you could fit on every
planet in the known universe if you
terraformed it like we have now
right that is a lot of people it might
turn out to be less than that but still
be a lot and what's cool there are a lot
more star wars in our galaxy so there is
so much you can do with these and many
do feel that eventually
the most common thing you'll see in this
galaxy or nazi because everything will
be concluded by them would be
matriarchal brains and other dyson type
of megastructurals swarming around these
stars sucking up every wasted photon to
just do calculation i don't know what
you answer with that presumably try to
find out what the question was that the
answer is 42 too
but you just find whatever answers
you're looking for or you emulate people
so those are all classic ones and say
if you don't like emulating people what
you go ahead and do
is you move on to my favorite one which
is build more living space for them
there was a presentation by our uh our
winning student team and i love the
student presentations yesterday at this
poster so you guys all have a chance to
see those yeah the magma one where they
actually walk through how much raw
materials there were in the solar
system's asteroid belt and how many
people that would support if you had
perfect recycling usage and i believe
they came up with a million billion i
for the figure 10 quadrillion a lot too
which is a little bit less than that
that's a lot of people right that's a
lot of people
and that's just the asteroid belt the
asteroid belt weighs less the moon than
the moon weighs to earth
and there's a thousand times more metals
in the sun we potentially extract too
with some mega structures via what we
call star lifting to build more of these
things so we say i love building new
places for people to live because i can
maybe put 10 times as many people on
classic plants in our solar system mars
venus venus is very very terraformable
work maybe even too if you get enough uh
solo shades in front of it
ten times as many people on it but if
i'm not using plants for habitation if
i'm instead using giant megastructures
you can start feeding a lot more of them
however it's not just for building
potential fake plants we have a lot of
examples of habitation megastructures
and i believe we had somebody want to
talk about uh
some of the other fun stuff the national
space site did before i launched into
that discussion
so we would take a quick pause real
quick for jump into the habitation
megastructures
to
[Music]
introduce david dressler the director of
information services for the national
space society and i would just let him
take my seat real quick to make that
easier
thank you isaac this is a real honor
having you here at isdc it's been uh
uh quite an eventful uh conference
overall but this is like the piester
resistance having live streaming to this
huge audience
there's many youtube streamers but isaac
is the one that's really forward-looking
and national space society embraces that
because
we're all about getting people off
planet living
in the solar system or throughout the
universe and isaac's
the vision he shares dovetails nicely
with what our organization is all about
what we need though as a society is more
membership
right now we currently have about 6 000
members
and you consider how many people watch
science fiction how many people watch
youtube streaming
and their subscribers are the numbers
are through the roof
so how can
we function as a society and embrace
these groups and bring them in and
increase our numbers as well
we can bring more youtubers to this
event in fact i've been in contact with
many of them and they are interested but
it's all about funding and really we
need funding as an organization to
take things to the next level
and uh
you know it's like here you get to meet
the scientists the engineers the
astronauts coming to this event is
really quite spectacular
we had a
panel yesterday morning that dennis
stone from nasa
the commercial operations manager
basically bringing in companies like
spacex and boeing
axiom that are actually building the
next level space habitats for low earth
orbit
i hope in about two or three years we're
talking to companies that are building
structures on the moon
and where do we go from there well mars
out to the gas giant planets and their
moons it's pretty much endless as far as
how far we can go
so help us as an organization go to
nss.org
actually space.nss.org
and think of it check out our website
check out our blog
and consider joining us
we'd really love to have you all out
there thank you very much
thank you so much dave and one thing as
we get back into this
the
talk that i was planning to give on this
i originally even think about giving it
back in 2020 when i'd received the
pioneer award and i couldn't come in
person to give that presentation
because of covet we all love covid this
is the third time i've had a chance to
speak to a live audience since covid
came out and i'm really grateful the
opportunity it is definitely a different
experience to be able to do it you know
as opposed to having you everything live
stream movie zoom so
um
we
found the topic just kind of going
through as a subject saying i want to
talk more about this but there was no
way no way at all that we're going to
get through every last megastructure
there are 70 slides in this this makes a
very long you know long talk
so i decided i need to do another
episode for it and i
have always been asked can i redo that
original episode to cover these topics
in more detail so i said why not so on
june 9th we're releasing the whole
megastructural compendium as people
would ask for it's going to cover
everyone we could come over there there
were 100 megastructures
it is two hours long and it is
pre-recorded so let me move to pace and
i actually was so long i had to get my
wife sale to help me narrate that so the
first time we've had a co-narrated
episode or those times we've had chances
with some other youtubers and speaking
of that you should definitely get on
some of our sister channels like john
michael gautier or event horizon
or university and encourage them to
maybe do this without nss as well
because it is a great experience and a
great chance for people to interact more
with it so
everyone's channel regular knows i love
megastructurals that we use for
more space to live in and they are not
just in space so we're going to be going
through some categories i want to start
with the ones that aren't in space for
us we'll start with the onward ones
we'll go through to all space-based ones
then we'll even get to our artificial
planet scale ones and then we'll go to
the really interesting ones that make
planets very tiny there are a lot of
those and i love them so
with no further ado what exactly is it
that makes these things so awesome
planets versus megastructurals obviously
only enforce the habitation-based
megastructures you can use them for
terraforming like on mars like a big
solar shade but why would we say the
future of humanity
is on
megastructures not planets i mean i'll
say the exclusion there'd be people
living on earth for a long time to go
probably they end up turning north into
a bit of a maker structure itself and
the biggest advantage you have there are
all sorts of pros and all sorts of cons
and there's a lot of perceived cons i
want to walk through those real quick
before we get into those host of them
one of the known pros first
mars it takes a lot of effort to make
mars livable right and making it level
does not mean it's anything like earth
like there are very few ways you can
make the gravity higher there with
things like rotational spin gravity you
can make exactly whatever you want that
might not always be offline conditions
we're not limited to our flight
conditions we also want alien wards to
live on you want to go to the resort
where it's only a seventh of gravity but
in a mega structure it's different
between a cave and a house you get to
build the thing to whatever your
specifications are not what you find
and the other difference is that much
like a cave versus a house it uses a lot
less material you know you're thinking
about a mountain that's got maybe a
dozen caves in it but i think weighs a
few gigatons how many houses can you
build a few gigatons of stone
how many skyscrapers can build out that
much you know it's kind of the same
concept of the megastructure underneath
our feet is 4 000 miles of mostly hot
magma radioactive molten metal and other
dangerous things that we don't relate to
as much they're important to our ward
but you get around a lot of them you
know you can use that more efficiently i
don't know how thick the ideal
habitation maker structure would be
maybe it's a couple meters of earth and
soil maybe it's a kilometer but you get
much more efficient a million forward so
you can build a million times living
area out of the same material and you
have the sunlight for it earth only uses
about one two billionth of the sunlight
that we get off of the sun and all the
other plants combined maybe 100 million
tops all the rest of those photons go
out in space and are forever wasted most
of them will never ever even run into a
mode of dust in the rest of the time the
universe around it's a very long time a
lot of empty space
the other thing of course is since there
is a lot of empty space you can build a
mega structure wherever you want you're
not just limited to where the planets
happen to be aligned at you can move a
planet we'll talk about how you can move
a planet you can change the rotational
rate you can even change the gravity but
it takes a lot of walk all right
the mega structures you can place them
where you watch place them inside that
asteroid that's a very nice place to
live and you want gravity right you're
gonna mind the thing out right but you
want to have a place to live and here's
the other big one they're mobile
how many of our conflicts come from the
fact that neighboring countries or even
neighboring towns are next to each other
forever they have to deal with each
other there's sometimes advantages the
fact you have to to have a relationship
by sticking two kids in the room to you
know work it out a lot of times that
doesn't work out too well right and we
have a whole array of megastructures
that are just devoted to blowing stuff
up that we probably don't want to see
get used to handle those kind of
conflicts
every one of these kind of
megastructures they're not ideal
spaceships in most cases but they are a
spaceship you can move them you can move
your community and o'neill cylinder is
like the size of the typical american
county that's a nice little subdivision
maybe it's sovereign nation maybe it
sides hey we're the county of o'neill in
the state of i don't know where you're
from let's say oklahoma and we decided
we don't want you know copenhagen we're
going to be a part of
texas or alabama or we decide to be a
part of switzerland or we decide to be
our own sovereign nation they can move
that's a big advantage to megastructures
they don't have to keep the same
neighbors the questions because the cons
of course is cost you're going to build
a planet that cannot possibly be cheap
there's nothing cheap about building a
plant but you're actually not building a
planet right you're building just what
you need at the time that's a nice
feature you build what you need at the
time how much the cost of all the
housing united states when people first
came here or decided to colonize this or
that part of the world they didn't start
by building every last house road they
built as they needed one of our problems
with terraforming is that you kind of
have to
do it all at once you don't get as much
modularity you can pay retail for them
build your domes your habitats
underneath that but they don't really
kind of mega structures themselves and
that's one of our categories we're gonna
get you in just a moment are those
on-board megastructures so you're
basically you're building a dome you're
building a floor you're building
everything you need there what really is
differently a motion dome and a audio
over around models
easy access to materials basically to
build stuff out of that's not really a
reason to live on planets because you
gotta deal with all that gravity right
so the other question of course you have
to maintain it but you have to maintain
planets too right we we are learning
that our ancestors already knew that
they had all those canals and farmers
maintained they got that we're getting
that again planets are hard to maintain
ecologies are hard to maintain and they
have to be maintained
a planet is not just something you'd
like to sit there forever they are not
permanent they are not static
and then of course when you terraformed
it is even less static
who here thinks that mars is going to
stay terrifying we just got done left
that way probably not right okay
so then there's the other question and
say is safety people boy if i live
inside a big tin can i'm not going to
die
and i said well
how thick is it what's protecting you
right now from an asteroid hideous thin
air right
it's actually a surprise a good shield
but still all the protective door that
wonderful metal is beneath us
it doesn't really protect us very much
from anything other than the planet
itself which is
being a big radioactive ball of molten
metal not necessarily the safest place
in the world in most these
megastructures not only would you have
the floor underneath you spinning around
but you also have all that additional
shielding
so i would say they're pretty safe too
you put a superstructure around one as
thick as you want full of gas and it's
over your head too you know it's
protecting you so that again is mostly
for orbital ones but we also have all
those ground-based ones i don't want to
just get in the habit of thinking of
these things only as in space we already
have a lot of megastructures and one of
the reasons why we're looking at
building them more here on earth
is because they have ways of
meeting needs we need right here on
earth what do we need living space we're
going to need more living space every
city goes upward and said just that wood
because they got location location
location for every space habitat we
build on a distant ward we're going to
build another one orbit of earth and
we're going to build more down here on
earth even when there's a trillion
people i guess most of them will live
near earth maybe in low orbits maybe in
megastructure so of course we need a
living space and we need what in
addition we need living space we're
going to need to have places people want
to live classic science fiction is full
of concrete and steel wastelands or
cities you don't want to live there you
don't want to eat soil and grain maybe
maybe you want to eat soylent green most
of us don't want to eat swimming queen
uh but
this is a false image we see as we get
uh even nowadays so much greener
so much more options for having pretty
cities potentially even parks insider
cities so we get the arcology
architecture that's based on ecology and
one of the things that also helps us to
answer isn't just the need for people to
have an actual ecosystem that's not just
you know a jungle of concrete and steel
around them but plants and of course
we'd like to eat them too so our
megastructures can potentially solve
that rule
they can be your living space your
growing space and we have paradigms that
can change if power gets way cheaper
suddenly having controlled
greenhouse-like environments where you
have the temperature or the atmosphere
or the humidity all of them control
specifically those are vastly more
productive right they are way more
productive they're really expensive to
build
and you have to power them right
however that expense is entirely based
off of what automation if i can build a
million self-replicating power
collectors and robots to build them then
that whole that i can build towers for
greenhouses the same way and i can power
them maybe get cheap fusion who knows
the idea if you have abundant power and
good automation which it seems like
we're moving to i hope because if we
don't get those we're probably in a lot
more trouble if we get them though the
paradigm shifts suddenly you can start
having giant towers that grow food right
suddenly you don't have to say
all of our arable land and all of our
forests all have to be knocked over for
more cities everything gets crushed in
the face of that concrete steel thing
because now you just don't need that
many people your real
limitation on space becomes
getting rid of heat right
that's becomes the new paradigm and
that's your real limitation at that
point is getting rid of heat and you do
not ever actually max the plant out to
that point you never get to new york
city that was a density planet wide
before you just can't get rid of your
heat anyway so you don't actually have
to have those horrible concrete
wastelands that we see in sci-fi unless
you really want to some people want to
run around with mutant cannibals right
it might be interesting but what we find
is that those are good examples of
closed ecosystem right our all ecologies
our architecture based on ecology is to
some degree closed
because this to some degree closed never
will content closed as needs that energy
input for instance might need raw
materials might need walkers these are
the same on earth then as they are in
other words or in space
all of your effort goes towards trying
to make a habitat that can exist almost
anywhere and the ecology that functions
for it they are a silk community that
functions there and it's just the idea
that the human
community of that closed habitat being
an arcology a space station or floating
island city is as self-contained as you
can reasonably get it
not because you don't want trade or
exchange of ideas but because it's more
efficient to be able to be as
self-sufficient as you can be and that
of course sets up well for space where
we have no choice be as self-sufficient
as we can be because it's hard to import
stuff from ultimos
and it's even harder to do to alpha
centauri yeah so
we have to become masters of the closed
environment
there are other mega structures you can
have on a plant though i don't know my
favorite ones are the ones that help us
get off the planet yeah um
i love spacex i always feel bad because
they were my bad predictions i thought
they were gonna fail i thought like
everything else i thought we would have
that just collapse all of us who kind of
grew up in the the 80s and the 90s but
we only saw the apollo landings on mtv
we remember just getting that one after
another we'll be back to the moon by
then and all those kind of they hard to
stay optimistic doing all that
um
then we get these launches and they
walked before that though i was saying
well you're not really the rockets to
actually walk that one i still think
there's a limit what you can do really
do with chemistry right if you really
want to send tons and tons mega tons of
people up to space every day make sense
of cargo back and forth every day it
does help to utilize some of the mega
structures that have the option
to actually carry us directly into space
my personal favorite is the orbital ring
but a lot of folks are very fond of the
lost room loop of course the space tower
space elevator a lot of options become
way more powerful
if you have vast amounts of power
active support you hear us familiar with
the lofstrom loop is an idea a pretty
popular one run a lot of energy through
metal run very fast metal through a
system holds itself a loft and you can
magnetically propel yourself like a
train writer space i love the idea of a
train to space
space elevators you can run one or two
cars straight up thing you need super
materials with exports which really
would help if you had magnetically
shielding materials that we have now and
superconductors you could potentially
send mega tons of space mega tons of
cargo space every day every day for a
dollar kilogram or something like that
some absolutely low tiny number most
becomes a maintenance thing that is when
you really start getting to have that
sci-fi future we all really want which
isn't to see astronauts on the moon but
to be able to go there to see the
disneyland park there to actually go
look at that giant parabolic you know
dark side of the moon telescope that's a
mile across
that's what we really want to learn from
if we really want to be able to plant
people in space and not just a small
seed that will grow but we can actually
allow people to really migrate without
have to be the cream of the crop but
just regular joe's moving there you need
things like launch assist systems
because chemical rockets probably won't
do it maybe i'll be wrong about that one
i don't mind being proven wrong and i
have been proven wrong by spacex before
but to me that's where you start
eventually move on to these launch
assist systems
to get you into space and into orbit and
of course that takes us to orbital
habitats nothing new to anybody here
what we got by the screen right now is
another one of our favorite animations
by udu schroeder another one of our
channel animators this is the assembly
of an o'neill cylinder everybody here
knows the odeo cylinder there are some
other ones we'd love to talk about on
the show
like the mckendree cylinder or the
bishop ring there are the big brothers
those you could potentially build with
graphene right i love audio sorters we
have
four or five episodes just devoted those
like
we have one that's called life on board
of new york soda and what you find when
you look at the topic more and more and
this this horse is true for stanford
tauruses and other ones too but
what you find more and more is it
becomes about layers of ecology
everything inside one of those becomes
the idea that you have an ecosystem a
technological ecosystem a cyber
ecosystem you actually have to start
working towards tailoring everything to
that and one things i love about that is
it means each one of these things is own
unique planet
i didn't say well i'm boy these things
be repetitive they're kind of boring you
say the sci-fi videos around about these
things it's all like the suburbs in
space there's only a suburban space it's
just like
and i think every one of them would be
really unique in its own way and would
have to grow more so with time so even
though you can do all sorts of things
these to have alien environments things
you could never ever find on the planets
right the most alien things you're ever
going to build are going to be things
you build not just find
but you have so much room for variation
just inside these one things i love
about orbital habitats is that they make
an option for nature preserves you know
we often talk about moving humanity off
of earth to save earth and be able to
use it again for the ecosystem
in some ways it's probably a lot easier
to go ahead and build on your cylinders
and put ecosystems in them especially
because that protects them not just for
people it's really hard to have people
just wandering into an o'neill cylinder
without permission right there's a short
way a number of ways to get in but you
also protect them from their fellow
ecosystems you get the invasive species
thing that that is it's natural but it's
regular and of course it happens a lot
faster with us around because we tend to
transport in organisms without their
natural predators prey and so forth
there
um so i'd like one of your sonos as an
option for ecosystems too i know they'll
have tests too here we've got a stanford
taurus same same one
stanford taurus you're always your best
one to start off with because it focuses
on
we need a certain number of rotations
per minute to actually keep people
comfortable with gravity without
vomiting so you'll see a lot more of
those and people sometimes say they're
smaller they're less mass efficient so
we see more neo cylinders i'm not so
sure about that because we love the
o'neill zone of how big it is we love
the mckenzie cylinder for how much
bigger it is but in many ways
the smaller ones are nice you see you've
got the smaller space appeal now we've
got a mckendree cylinder to scale at
least we'll get to scale in a moment
when we see neptune in the background so
these are common class habitats i love
them they're huge you can fit
billions of people inside one either
single layer they are awesome
but a lot of times what you're really
going to see is a lot more of the
smaller ones everybody here has seen
brian versus art he is amazing i love
getting to work with him he has loaned
us quite a lot of his out for the
channel and this is the inside of the
capalla station and it of course
is only time for maybe a few hundred
people
but which is likely to be more common
are there more villages or cities
even a civilization that can build
machinery cylinders or even bigger
things like a niven ringworld you're
still gonna have a lot of people just
want the smaller one for themselves
now i think we're probably running low
on time was that the yep so we're gonna
start moving forward
much faster
asteroid mines
we want to be able to carve out all that
wonderful space gold one but people they
are
they are going to need to have lives of
their own at some point in time that we
want to move out there and have a
community what is san francisco best
known for right now it's not the gold
rush
there's not you know about three or four
million people in san francisco mining
gold those mines they become the basis
for people to live in they become the
way that people find themselves they
become the shielding it protects them
you just carve the cylinder right into
it
you put a protective shell around it so
you don't actually rotate the asteroid
or fall apart but becomes yours your
economy your protection your location
your civilization you get some very big
ones that way
so
deep space habitats are pretty much the
same idea they are you say what is in
deep space that you could live off
there's no sunlight no maybe got fusion
right there's actually a lot of economic
opportunities even beyond the kuiper
belt
all those gigantic telescopes we want to
build all those energy relay pushing
systems that might create laser highways
between stars
those things would presumably have
people that lived on them unless you
really trust your artificial
intelligence which
me maybe you do maybe you don't um your
ultra secure science labs that place
where you keep your antimatter stored at
if you get that working because you
don't keep that anywhere near a planet
at least not a planet you like so deep
space habitats another place people
might live you got a lot of space and of
course the you know scholarships
themselves those again are all mega
structures
you know you have to move on ecology and
see if i got self-replicating machines i
always heard of von neumann's machines
you go launch the thing though there and
it creates a whole bunch of itself and
they split out and do the same well if
it's a software key machine why launch
during the source system you can launch
it an unused asteroid and say build me
only or so
say now put an engine on the back of
that so instead of just sending one
small approach to another solar system
you send one small approach or an
asteroid and say be able to build
yourself and infect all the other
asteroids and make me giant oak ships
and you can fuel above a jupiter it's
got a lot of fuel or whatever we're
using as power source the sun push yet
and you send those giant ark ships those
giant civilizations communities all by
themselves off the stars and those your
mega structures and you might find when
people get there
they like living on board those more
they like some plants that's going to
take them thousands of years to colonize
it one difference you have with space
travel in the future is you do your
space infrastructure before you do your
planet in other systems you set that up
first perhaps
but of course everyone still loves
planets let's skip through the
generation triple fade because we are
time limited
giant artificial planets one thing i
love about active support if you have a
lot of energy if you have just vast
amounts of energy automation you can
just build a planet if you can make
artificial black holes to stretch you
can make them any size you feel like
because it's arbitrary mass then your
mass
scales even with your surface area if
you want the same gravity you want to
plant 10 times bigger it needs 10 times
the surface area needs ten times the
mass for the same gravity black holes
are nice for that or you could just fill
up a giant shell for orbital rings with
uh gas you can build around saturn you
can wrap saturn orbital rings plate it
over and uh as a result of that
you could build a planetary surface
there but other overall although mirrors
up in place they'll light up more now
saturn is a livable ecosystem a lot of
work to do that obviously but i'm not
really sure it's that much more than
terrifying oversized planet would be you
build your rings around them your vast
energy power source
because of course it's not something
we're building any time too soon
and then you cover it over
and then you don't earth and sand and
one on it you got a planet
pop probably not quite that easy but you
get there and i don't think that at that
point in time it's really any different
than trying to telephone planet
they could be big or small i don't know
how small you could really build one but
if you're willing to put a blast sphere
around to contain the atmosphere you
could probably have one that was the
size of that little rick and morty
planet where they accidentally crashed
their van into it because it's only
about the size of a football field or
you could build one that is
a million times bigger than earth right
we don't know if we could ever actually
make artificial black holes but we
couldn't find some
if you have what three or a million
times the mass of the sun of the earth
in a black hole a small one that gives
you a million times surface area if you
put something around it what are you
pounding off of well you're dumping
material down there and you're running
off the radiation coming off the
accretion disk you might find that those
become the most popular places for
people to live in the future
as they just go ahead and build giant
big structures around black holes which
have all sorts of other uses for
interstellar black hole highways and
things along those lines we get to
ringworld which you can actually build a
ring ward without a super tensile
material by active sport again you put a
second bigger ring behind it that
doesn't spin that much and all it is is
mass plus a magnetic field foot to push
against it replaces clumsily but it gets
the job done while we see from script
with things like very different reward
it's a bit of a push and i don't know
why you ever built it but that's one of
those questions we get to
is why would you ever build these things
some though you don't have to really
have high technology with we have one
that's called a rungworld it's basically
a bunch of o'neill cylinders or mchenry
cylinders connected by tether that
rotate around the star just like a
ringworld does but the gravity is done
by their own rotation themselves
they don't have to be made out of
anything strong at all just steel or
graphene
they become great and
i love them because we could build them
and you could go along with tethers and
you still get that ringworld size and of
course you can
push that all the way up to the point
stats
you're enclosing a whole stall
just like you can with ringworld so you
get a dyson
shell
if we can get the graphics to comply
one of the things i love about dyson
spheres is they're completely impossible
to build
uh and you can build one especially
because of the artificial gravity you
can just put a static shell around one
as well i think we might have just
frozen our presentation
but with wrong words or rewards you can
place them in angles around the star to
absorb all the sunlight and therefore
you're not actually stuck using
whatever super materials you're never
going to find out in an event long words
don't have to be made of super strong
materials either that allows you to
actually have contiguous communities all
around an orbital path around a star and
that forms up into maybe your super
nation of the future a long ward that
has maybe one percent of the sun's light
being eclipsed on it and there's a
couple hundred of those that might be
the future of humanity in this solar
system as a dyson swarm or dyson shell
made of lung warts or ring wards that uh
just are home to billions upon billions
of people
and that just lets you do billions upon
billions of tasks we can do now
so i do think we did get frozen there so
we can't show you the bulge planet
but i always describe it real quick if
you're building big black hole based
megastructures one of the ones you have
as an option is to build it around a
galactic central mass black hole and
those give you options like
instead of just a a dyson swarm you have
something that had home to well
trillions upon trillions of people
because it would have a surface area
bigger than the entire
number of plants the entire universe
they get to be very big
millions of times the mass of our sun
means millions of millions of times the
surface area of earth that could be your
largest megastructure people could live
on is it possible under known physics
yes actually it might be a little bit
harder and so i think on that
yep we're going to have to skip forward
so i think we're going to skip all our
keep shape plants and ring shape plants
loop shaped plants and recommend those
episodes to you and now we're going to
go and move on to questions
[Applause]
i love technology always freezes
questions from the audience here
hi nice presentation thank you if you
have um
a
habitat for trillions of people have you
ever considered what it might take to
keep trillions of people um organized in
a functional society one of my favorite
episodes to do was uh the future of
governments and then that one we list
off every known type of government we
could think of somebody asked me what do
you think the future of human government
civilization would be i said it's gonna
be all of the above and we just wrote a
list that went on for like three minutes
long of every listed type of government
uh one nice thing about post-scarcity
civilizations too is you can get a lot
of systems of government that might not
be
as functional just because you have so
much resources and because everyone's
mobile they potentially move to
communities they like better nonetheless
how do you actually administrate to a
trillion people
i don't know that you do
you know we always talk about these
galactic empires and i always use that
kind of a meta sense i even if you
mention around the the speed of light is
an issue which i don't think we have a
will
i don't think you ever would have a
unified galactic empire i don't think
you have a unified solar empire um i
think you'd instead have just billions
upon millions of communities and given
that they could still be billions strong
you know that's a lot of people to
handle
hi isaac
so
obviously there's going to be mega
structures built by all sorts of
different people and corporations and
governments i hope so but in your
opinion for the first habitable
megastructure
who's going to build the first one would
it be a corporation or a government or
what i mean i guess we could go back to
the idea that we've already had them
built in the past too um
trying to figure out what exactly
motivates people to build them it's
going to depend a lot on what what
breaks forced on getting into space if
we get space based solar power probably
that i mean that could be entirely
modular small ones i could see that
happening uh or totally it might be an
asteroid mine then they decide that
they've got all that space score they're
gonna build themselves a giant space
habitat you know bezos one or whatever
it be um
it's gonna be something that has
economic sense though if you have a neo
cylinder built for a million people it's
not because there's only a million
people living in space there's probably
tens of millions already up there before
it gets commissioned
scalable you know
hi isaac um
i'd come up with an idea a while back
and i wasn't sure if it was something
that was already in the literature or
whatever but the idea was you have your
home's home world
if you had a shell of starships moving a
relativistic speed expanding away from
that world
and they're all artificial intelligence
and they're using quantum entanglement
so that signals can go across the entire
thing
it would be interesting from a
standpoint of if you're on the edge of
that and you're observing things and you
want something computed really fast from
your perspective
you would send the signal back to the
home world where it's
relativistic speeds are not applying
and it would almost be instantaneous
once you were
out in the shell even though it might
take 10 years to compute
i'm not going to say that wouldn't work
but again i'm i'm a real
quantum entanglement
i'm wondering if that's already in the
literature somewhere or if it was
original a lot of people written about
using quantum entitlement as ftl i tend
to be very skeptical about ever being
used that way
of just
creating a civilization where
uh the outer shell of something is
moving a relativistic speed and the core
is moving at normal speed
and they're using that as sort of a i
don't think you'd actually have a
contiguous civilization even though just
because they're spreading out so fast if
they're if they're calling home for
communications they're going to localize
a lot i think there too you know if you
if you're spitting out from ethiopia you
don't really send a message home to
ethiopia before you cross the land
bridge it's too complicated for you to
do it even though they're moving pretty
fast so
what uh ideas from this conference have
you seen the most intriguing you know
and are you most interested in making
new episodes about
you know i'm that's actually a great
question because i have a little list of
them i've been writing up i'm going to
use a poll for the uh youtube audience
probably not until monday though just
have a chance to go through them um the
ones that i saw today are always the
ones that most on my mind so i'll make
sure i'm doing a fail i just got done
with logan's presentation for their
sponsor you do an episode uh they were
kind of probably
i was thinking about staying sane in
space that's a tempting one to do uh
mars is always attempting to do i think
i really do need to redo we did a look
at power satellites years ago
um but i feel like that topic needs
updated a lot i think space based solar
is what i almost certainly want to do
again too but i think i'll probably just
go back through the entire syllabus list
of them and just start picking which
ones i want to try so yeah the
information that jim green shared today
during lunch that was a real eye-opener
about what mars is about with the liquid
core and yeah we have just done an
episode on on making a magnetosphere for
mars a couple of months ago as well as
new king bolas for for tearful that's
mostly why that wasn't a good idea but
still to do it and i i i could never
miles is just such a fun topic there's
so much
there's always something new every year
too
thank you isaac arthur for presenting
this space megastructures this is this
idea is uh amazingly mind expanding but
intuitively i think structures are
portrayed as being crushed or too
unwieldy has anybody ever thought of
having substructures connected
electromagnetically in space
i think and that is one of the things
about a lot of these is
we
you our artists are trying to keep it
relatively simple both for animation
reasons and for the purpose of showing
them so we see this on neo centers this
big cylinder spinning in space in
practice it would probably be one of you
have a habitation drum or one or two of
them in a giant complex that most of
which wasn't spinning it was spinning
slower you know i think you'd have a lot
of things that are connected by tethers
i think a lot of stuff magnetically in
there too i i think you just it's
think of a city in which you have a few
skyscrapers and a lot more
infrastructure i tend to think a real
space set of an overall space and it
looks more like that
there's a few big structures
and a lot of other stuff just connected
to it a lot of which is mobile which
leaves comes in etc and so
i think that's probably an entire area
of logistical nightmares for a future
generation yet to come but
if you can just shut you know
there's no friction with
electromagnetism right that's one thing
i like about them is launch cannons you
don't have to worry about material
limits as much with them so yes i think
that would be a big factor a lot of
these two not just relying on classic
tensile strength
okay time for more okay so i'm just
asking have you
have you
have you met or are familiar with the
visionary architect late visionary
architect paulo solari have you ever
been to arkham sunny uh the arcology is
original designer so yeah
um
it's actually a little bit embarrassing
i actually put the wrong photograph i've
been on the one episode that we will we
will mention him in our ecologies
episode i'd never trust google in the
future thoughts
but yeah he had some wonderful
interesting designs just the whole idea
of our college is pretty cool thank you
so i saw larry niven on your list i
thought uh would you like to interview
him for one of your shows yeah we don't
usually do interviews on the show but i
would cheerfully break that rule for him
okay he's been our book of the month
winner well every time i give excuse
usually once a year asthma of heinlein
or niven windsor just because there's so
much content from those folks they're
amazing so oh and he's a kick too he
comes up with some pretty humor yeah so
we need the biggest stretches a lot of
ones with the skip too unfortunately
today uh come from niven's work but uh
yeah some have episodes i will recommend
you guys those do you see the animations
at your leisure then
do you have time for another one nice
sure
so
humans are obviously pretty fragile we
only like certain temperature ranges
certain atmospheric environments in the
future
when colonizing space what do you think
the trade-off is going to look like
between
engineering habitats that fit baseline
humans versus people modifying
themselves to survive in environments
that might be more economical there's
the tail forwarding versus bio-forming
issue as to say as we've moved out to
different climates you can modify
yourself to your climate you can modify
the climate to you or you can do a
little bit of both traditionally we tend
to do a little bit of both and i think
that you'd see well
you have some people who do absolutely
want to modify the environment
completely them and that's one thing i
love about megastructures you can tailor
it to whatever you want which might not
be earth normal it might be reorder you
might decide you want to do an
mc-escher-like setup if you can you know
uh and you could probably use some
really strange interiors on these things
but i do think that you would always see
a lot of focus on trying to
change the environment to be around you
especially because you're not just
changing it to humans you're changing to
our whole ecosystem we don't really know
how well
bees and other pollinators are going to
do in weird magnetic fields or real
gravity they're going to have to become
masters at ecology
to get into space let's see people say
well we can just use this plan up and
move to another one nope
there's no circumstance where you ever
not be able to terraform earth if you
nuke this thing until it glows where it
wouldn't be easier to tear from earth
again than it would be to colonize
another planet even ignoring that you
don't have any infrastructure there to
do it
if you want to be good at from other
plants or building mega structures fully
you know for habitation you must become
a master of biology and ecology not just
physics engineering
so we have two questions from the online
audience just before we wrap up and
thanks to syndry for helping us moderate
the chat again
as always so ronald decker wants to know
if a
nikhil dyson beam infrastructure cannot
be distinguished from a dyson swarm that
wouldn't watching a dyson swarm being
built
a potential threat to a civilization
watching it be built yeah uh i mean
think of there's a lot of things to do
with with a classic dyson swarm and the
thing is it's not really you can
probably purpose build one to be really
good at one task but think of every one
of them as a matriarchal brain in part
as a chicago thrust or be able to move a
stall in part as a giant weapons
platform import or ship driving parts
and you start seeing people building a
dyson swarm you probably want to say
hello to them
you really don't want your name to check
their intentions because you remember
that there's a time lag on this thing
once they get it done they can fire it
and that might be a thousand years ago
you'll only know when it fires because
the beam's traveling at light speed and
there are actually worse things you can
do than seven beer people too but uh
with one of those which we'll skip for
now uh relativistic kill missiles we'll
see them in the uh episode on june 9th
but
always good to to open relations with
anybody who you see has a lot of muscle
and the last question is from channel
regular albert jackson good afternoon
isaac this was a great show today how
would programmable or smart matter
change or generally impact architecture
well it depends on how smart your
programmable it is um you know we have a
concept called a catam it's kind of like
the basic atom of uh of something
clay-based that you might build small
metal or flexible buildings out of and
those don't have to be a single type any
more than atoms are but uh
there's always gonna be a cost in moving
them keeping them together they're
always going to be weaker than any
material that's really based on straight
atomic bonds
but uh this you can still make a really
strong like a
graphene cation is probably
strong enough that you could build
skyscrapers out of the stuff flexibly so
i
i actually have no idea a good question
this is there's so much room on that one
if you can move around you like you can
change the rooms at whim
i think that you you would see
probably a lot of multi-purpose rooms
but certainly we've already seen that
it's like very soon like if you have a
lot more in virtual space when you have
a lot more augmented reality or virtual
reality that people tend to spend a lot
of their time in
the shifts that are one of those ones
where i can imagine a few possibilities
but i i bet i'm gonna be guessing about
as accurate as i would like because this
is the small phone if i was uh talking
to joel's walls a century ago so just
very fast
so i'll get on mike uh the opening
chapter of the machine stops written in
1905 is a room that's all reconfigured
like that where you touch something and
it turns into a bed or whatever
um it's obviously i think those cities
benefit zoning imagine zoning inside a
city that was made out of smart metal
what can you allow to change the
building into anyway yes
that's small cities
i think they will go ahead and sign out
there again today thank you to all the
audience here at the international space
development conference thank you arthur
again national space station for hosos
