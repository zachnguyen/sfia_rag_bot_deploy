Astrochickens & Von Neumann Probes
The galaxy is huge.
It’s so big that if we sent out a new space
probe to a star every single day, it would
take over a billion years before we sent one
probe to each star, and that’s just in this
galaxy.
And almost none of those probes would reach
their destination, as they might need to keep
functioning for tens of thousands if not millions
of years just to get to their destination.
One answer to that is the von Neumann Self-Replicating
Probe, a class of probes that arrives at a
nearby star, rendezvous with some asteroid
or small moon, and make several copies of
itself to explore that system and send others
to every star in range.
The Dyson Astrochicken is a type of von Neuman
Probe massing 1 kilogram that hatches solar
panels as it approaches a star and uses those
to run an ion drive and self-replication processes.
See our self-replicating spacecraft episode
for more details.
