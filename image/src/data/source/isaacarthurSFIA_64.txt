We often talk about encountering intelligent 
extraterrestrial or sentient life off Earth,  
but this can be somewhat confusing since 
definitions for Sentience can vary and by  
default is simply the ability to experience 
sensations and feelings. This would seem  
to include anything in the animal kingdom 
and certainly any of the smarter critters  
we tend to keep as pets. There’s an elusive 
line between them and us and we often refer  
to this as sapience, as the possession of 
wisdom or ability to reflect on memories. 
While they do often get used interchangeably, 
Sentience is a basic level of consciousness,  
encompassing the capacity to feel pleasure 
and pain. A sentient being is aware of  
its surroundings and experiences 
emotions or physical sensations.
Sapience, on the other hand, is a step further. 
Though what that step is remains unclear,  
but finding out will be important to artificial 
intelligence and potentially uplifting animals to  
make them smarter, as we looked at recently 
in our episode, is Uplifting Ethical?
