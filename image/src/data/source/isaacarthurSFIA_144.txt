The Stanford Torus is an enormous 10 million ton 
space station habitat first proposed in 1975 to  
house 10,000 inhabitants at a station diameter of 
1.8 kilometers or just over a mile. The habitat  
section is a wide hollow, donut-shaped ring, 
or torus, whose inner edge is transparent and  
whose outer edge is for people and their 
landscape. By rotating once per minute,  
it provides spin-gravity to the inhabitants 
and visitors, and can use a large mirror  
to send filtered sunlight into the habitat.
The Stanford Torus design has many variations,  
often including multiple rings of larger 
diameters for more living area and various  
ancillary facilities, from power collectors to 
refineries or smaller agricultural stations. A  
docking module at the center includes secondary 
mirrors to direct sunlight from the primary mirror  
to the habitat, as well as a place for ships 
to dock and unload, or be repaired or built.
