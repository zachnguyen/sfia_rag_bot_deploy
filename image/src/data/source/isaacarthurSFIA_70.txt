While folks often point to the Red Planet as 
a place for humanity to colonize and terraform  
to be a new Earth, Venus is often considered 
a better target than Mars for this effort.  
Venus has 91% of Earth’s gravity and 90% of 
its surface area while Mars has only 38% of  
our gravity and 28% of Earth’s surface area.
But Venus, while once thought a paradise planet,  
has a day longer than its year, 
rains acid, and is so hot it  
is less a paradise than a suburb of hell.
One approach to handling this, as we detailed  
in our episode Winter on Venus, is to place large 
solar shades at Venus’s L1 Lagrange Point between  
it and the Sun, allowing it to cool over a couple 
of centuries to a temperature more like Earth,  
which could then be maintained while a 
second constellation of mirrors could  
orbit once every 24 hours to give Venus a 
day length and brightness like Earth has.
