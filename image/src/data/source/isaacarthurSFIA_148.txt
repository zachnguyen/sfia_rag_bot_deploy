A popular speculation in scifi is that 
the Dinosaurs might have been an advanced  
civilization, and that they were wiped out by some 
unnatural cataclysm. Possibly by a galaxy wide war  
among dawn civilizations that left everything in 
ruins and from which we are just now recovering.  
And this is a popular solution for the Fermi 
Paradox about where all the aliens are. 
Good stories, but we have no evidence dinosaurs 
ever had big brains. Though some would argue that  
we have little evidence about them at all. Even a 
hundred fossils from a ten million year period is  
just one fossil per hundred thousand years, which 
wouldn’t tell you much about humanity, especially  
if it was gorilla or dolphin fossil, and skull 
size says little of intelligence. Could millions  
of years erase evidence of prior civilizations on 
Earth? See our episode the Silurian Hypothesis,  
to see if we could even find such ruins, if 
they existed or if we would leave any ourselves.
