[Music]
we usually go for about an hour so you
probably want to grab a drink
and a snack though we'll take a break
about halfway through too
with all that said welcome and let's get
started
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
our monthly livestream q a
uh for january 2021 we'll get to your
questions in just a moment but
you may have noticed as i mentioned
coming into this session for the day
sarah my wife who usually asks the
questions is not going to be here today
we're instead going to be joined by my
friend
david thomas who will be reading off the
questions as we go
and we'll go ahead and get started yes
i'm certainly not as good looking as
sarah is so
i apologize to your audience but thank
you so much isaac this is really
exciting
so isaac your first question my question
is
could you explain or go deeper into
sci-fi or interstellar ship crew
compositions
information about that topic is of
course very scarce but i would like to
hear your opinion on it
how big would they need to be what are
the numbers like
like in star wars or in 40k they seem
way too high though
um you know one of the things you have
pop up a lot in science fiction is the
ships are either very small like the
size of a bus
or they are the size of a state or city
and there's some amount of accuracy
there if the uh the big reveal on
on the is you know the star destroyer in
the original star wars new hope episode
four uh it just rolls on screen it's
huge and that franchise they actually
had the crew compliments about right
uh they are talking about like tens of
thousands of people with one of those
things or even hundreds of thousands
um which is still a little on the low
side and
with a lot of automation you might not
need that many people but then when star
trek
decided to do the next generation about
the new enterprise the ship's basically
supposed to be like half a mile long
and it's got like 40 decks like oh
there's a thousand people on board this
ship
and you think about how big the ship is
that point in time
or even with ones like 40k where they'll
say they cram a million people on one of
those ships is like 10 kilometers long
you think oh it must be packed
but you run the numbers on that you
realize that even if 90 of it was
places no one could actually enter
they'd still have like
one person per warehouse densities
inside the place
um and of course for a lot of ships
that's probably all you really need is
that level with all the automation but
the question then becomes why is the
ship so big and with something like a
fusion torx drive you might have to have
it that big just because
fusion engines are pretty much always
going to have an efficiency tied to
their size the bigger they are the more
efficient and they're likely to be
um and uh although of course do we get
one we're not gonna know
so you might get really big ships that
way and this is what are you doing with
the rest of the ship
um and empty space is pretty much free
in space we don't have
air friction either so you could get
those really big ships
the other thing though is the fleet
sizes um it makes sense to have
hundreds of thousands of crew on a big
starship if you've got
trillions of trades people if you've got
thousands of plants in your star empire
you should have populations of many
trillions if not quadrillions
and if one out of thousand people is in
your navy
uh then you should have billions or
trillions of people in this office
so uh i it's strange those sounds with
warhammer 40k being probably the least
realistic
sci-fi franchise even compared to star
wars scientifically speaking
they always get the numbers and scale
right so
imagine paying for all those people oh
good guy i think in 40k they're usually
slave gangs they pick up on plants and
empty out the prisons and the
falls please for the shooting give
slaves guns that's that's a good idea
next question isaac i'm assuming this is
speaking to you one of your last shows
at six minutes 26 seconds that view of
the rest of your studio
surprised me it seems like to be a
normal room with no acoustic tile my son
with a degree in film production tells
me their software that cancels out
echoes
are you using that and at 11 35 you
mentioned the tapestry to help with
sound absorption
um actually uh david you want to roll
the camera you might be able to see the
let me
switch over to his one real quick you
probably see the camera on the tapestry
right now uh
that is pretty much um
the studio and for the most part it's
the desk because again we mostly just
record audio in here
and um the tapestries help to resolve
noise there is
uh an insulation of the wall that was
picked specifically to help with sound
reduction when i had the office built
uh we'll probably be changing studios in
about four months too to go for a little
bit bigger and more professional but uh
there's actually got dropped sound tiles
and things but for the most part
um where sounds concerned you know you
need to eliminate any background sounds
you've got but i live out in the country
so uh there's usually not too much of it
to begin with and there is sound
deadening in the walls right around me
but mostly just try to limit the sound
that's going on there so
if the air conditioner is running i have
to shut it off for instance recording
this in the summer times
uh which can get very hot but other than
that
you know more sound stuff helps but we
don't really use anything specific this
is a usb condenser mic with a cardioid
filter so it kind of filters directly
towards me you can probably
see the thing right
there so that's the studio
it's a very neat setup really really
nice next question isaac
i'm glad i could catch the last sfi live
stream of the year
here are my two questions now the year's
over what are your thoughts on 2020
and what do you expect to happen in 2021
besides the continuation
of fighting the pandemic of course and
question two
when technology in some areas slows down
an advancement for a long time
do you think that will change the
definition of what is considered
old technology why or why not oh hi
again albert he's one of our regular
uh question fellow i'm sure he's here
today today that's that's some of the
questions we have from last time coming
in
uh while we get to the questions in um
i'd say the big wrap up i have on 2020
is um is just that as a rule
everyone is going to pretend the year
never happened it's it's gonna be one of
those years um
because it's been for most people uh
very bad here
it's actually been a really good year
for me personally uh and sarah would
agree with that
no she would not she had the ghost
getting married was like the one up spot
in the whole thing
unless you want to see it too but uh
let's see
um and i'd say that's the biggest
technological advancement we're going to
see
is probably going to be how to actually
manage people's locations
with privacy in mind um with uh
you know i want to know where people's
location is i can turn on my phone
and build an id where i'm at what time
and so forth we can keep all that
anonymously somewhere
and we keep everybody else's that way
too if they opt in say you had a policy
that was an opt-in
so if you got sick say your fitbit
you're wearing told you you're running a
fever
it could instantly ping it up to some
system which would automatically ping
everybody else who had been within
contact of you
anonymously within the last you know x
number of times saying hey you are near
someone who's got a fifa
get yourself checked and obviously
that's very simplistic but
that's the sort of approach that i think
you're going to see is how do we do that
not just for this
epidemic but for all the other ones
there are minor flu things
i do think this is probably going to be
our last epidemic ever
and i don't think that's very optimistic
but this is probably going to be it
because this will be so much advancement
so much focus on it and this one was
very close that almost did not happen so
that would be my big thought for that as
to
well qualifiers old tech there is no
such thing as old tech you know
the original six tools are what the
screw the ax the
wedge um the lever and some other ones
that escape my mind we still use them
all the time
uh so i don't really think of new
technolotec new is just something that
comes
recently came out with and never gets to
be old so all right so i guess we can
move on to the questions from this
weekend we should have a chance to have
gotten them into
the moderators by now let's certainly
hope that your prediction that this is
one of the last
pandemics is uh is very true so here's a
question for you
very topical this past week if you were
interviewing elon musk
what were some of the questions that you
would ask him
um hmm if i were interviewing elon musk
i wasn't the questions i'd ask him
uh why on earth did he smoke pot wires
on joe rogan oh
yeah i'm a fan of elon musk i i i notice
that people tend to break into they
either really like elon or they really
hate
elon i i tend to be the category of i
have a great deal of respect for him and
his work
uh but he makes mistakes too i think
he's a great guy
questions that ask him is basically um
what's next because every time i bet
against him he's turned out to be um
you can come on in by the way if you
like me um
uh there's another post in the studio
with us today but um
probably just something along those
lines uh that uh
you know what's the next project what's
what's the
details that we see what happens after
mars are you interested in asteroid
money but
the thing is he tends to let us know his
new ideas are as soon as he got them
pretty well
compartmentalized so i think that's uh
just kind of wait and see
he's fun to watch he's not getting us
into tesla that way a quick side note i
saw from syndry
one of our moderators he uh asked about
if i was aware that i was
an advisor voice for the mod for
stellaris and the answer was yes i
am in that video game mod and i did
agree to record those and i actually
made up about half of them they all
strange ones for those who don't know
the stellaris video game um
we sometimes use their music they're
from paradox they lent it out to us
but uh one of the more active players
asked if i would do a mod for the
advisor basically says things like
your ship has been completed you know
you're getting a new communication
and so this there is a mod for me that i
recorded those and i thought it was fun
to do so
feel free to go check that out i've got
the next question you've gone truly
virtual
yes so isaac how on megastructures
would you simulate hydrothermal activity
like you see in yellowstone
or other volcanic places that is
tricky um the the thing that i would say
is you can always simulate something
like that
uh whether or not you should it's kind
of like with magnetospheres
you can produce some magnetosphere on a
planet by speeding up the core and nuke
it over and over again or you could just
wrap a wire around the planet and turn
it on
it's not hard to generate a magnetic
field you don't need trillions and
trillions of tons of spinning hot molten
metal to do it
um and you don't really need trillions
of tons of molten
uh you know magma to keep your
landscaping refreshing you could just
have robots that will come like
drain out your empty ocean barrels and
bring them back up to the top when they
have too much sediment but to actually
simulate hydrothermal vents i think i
would just go really
really simplistic and put a pump and a
heat oil in underneath the ground
somewhere
have it turned on yeah fish tank you
basically
keep it simple next question
so isaac could neutron stars be viable
for hadron collider
possibly by dropping a white dwarf in
one and could stable charm quark matter
be made with one if you dropped a white
dwarf into a neutron star it would
cause actually i was going to say it
caused a supernova but i'm not sure that
would happen
uh i think you would get a lot of gold
from that actually two neutron stars
clay and get you a lot of gold two white
dwarfs which other heavy metals
you get a bunch of heavy metals out of
that collision and a big explosion
um and then a black hole i don't think
there's very many white dwarfs that
would be too unmassive that if you add
them to a neutron star that wouldn't be
enough to kick it over the limit
um well maybe not you might just get a
bigger neutron star out of it
uh i don't think you're getting i mean
you could get some very interesting
quark effects to be sure
but the thing about neutron stars is
they are made out of neutrons they are
up and down quarks though
we don't have any solid reason to think
they are strange or charm matter in
there though
it's been speculated that might be the
case beneath that level at the corkstar
level
which is the thought to be thing between
neutron stars and black holes or neutron
stars and planck stars
maybe but that's one of those ones where
i have to refer you to
a particle physicist um maybe i don't
know if he's on here right now but
um uh paul sutter from ohio state
uh we've done a collaboration with him
before that probably more up his alley
ask a space man that's a show
next question so it seems like the
phrase it's never aliens is being taken
too
far in scti it is always the last thing
to consider
as if the very notion is downright
unscientific
i know about occam's razor and if i
mispronounce any of these things i am
greatly sorry
and the history of false alarms but with
more and more instruments coming online
that are capable of detecting alien
civilizations
shouldn't we be holding out the
possibility as being a lot more
likely out of intellectual honesty i'll
come sorry sorry
i pronounced it right okay so it's
setting up
scti but setting the social stressful
intelligence for those that know
often called teddy uh um and occam's
razor for those who don't know is is the
idea that
the simplest and most obvious solution
is probably the correct one
and occam's razor often cuts very
sharply
and sometimes cuts incorrectly um
and you know we have the
i did not know what this actual meme was
for some years of running the show but
there's a guy who's got
einstein levels of hair uh who was on
the history channel a lot
who was known for basically saying it's
i'm not saying it's aliens but it's
always aliens
and the counter meme that i guess i got
hit with was
i'm not saying it's not aliens yes i am
or it's never aliens
uh you're a meme names
um but i don't think i have the hair for
it although although i usually call mine
out for fictionals if
you catch me walk around the house first
time i usually have my hair all puffy
seti the source fresh terrestrial
intelligence
is possible there are small aliens
somewhere inside our own galaxy i tend
to assume they are not
so i tend to assume the answer's always
going to be something natural but you
should never be rolling out that's the
mistake people make on that too it
shouldn't be the first thing you go to
um
you should always be looking for a
natural phenomena first um but well
actually that's not even true though you
should be looking for natural artificial
phenomena for us you should be looking
for the simplest explanation
and in astronomical cases that's usually
going to be something natural has been
the case every time so far we've had a
chance to get an answer
we have a lot of unexplained phenomena
so too that might be artificial
intelligence
um you're looking for the right answer
whether it's
you know uncomfortably alien or it's
natural or whatever it is
the right answer is the right answer and
you shouldn't reel it out but
like when tabby's stall came out one of
the first things a lot of people said is
oh everyone's saying it's aliens again
and said well all the people in the in
the field didn't think it was no
everyone i know in the field first thing
they thought in their head was i wonder
if it's aliens
they aren't easily rooted out you know
it's probably not but what's that went
through your head that might be a
dyson's form
you know that might be aliens maybe they
didn't think it was very probable but
the thought went to go ahead so everyone
is in science as a geek they've all
watched star trek you know star wars et
cetera
of course you thought it was aliens for
at least a brief moment um
and then you try to rule that one out
but my usual philosophy is if it is
artificial
it's going to show up as artificial for
a bunch of reasons if you stumble across
one screwdriver or hammer
or hand one natural it's kind of rock
shaped you might say well maybe that's
a natural object but when you walk into
a tool shop yeah that's artificial and
no one's gonna be like
i wonder if this is a nationally
occurring a workshop
i wonder if this toolbox is just
naturally occurred somewhere no you know
it's artificial
and i think with our first contact with
aliens it's probably going to be
something like that
you know when the flying saucer lands on
the white house front line you're not
like
i wonder if that's an asteroid no
that'd be a great way to end out 2020
but it didn't quite happen it wouldn't
even be the most interesting exciting or
crazy thing that happened in 2020
could be a good thing or a bad thing so
next question isaac can a planet that is
tidally locked to its star
have continents and oceans that move in
and out of the twilight zone of the
planet
forcing life onto land or water
i'm sorry can you see that one again
sure can a planet that is tidally locked
to its star have continents and oceans
that move in and out of the twilight
zone of the planet
forcing life onto land or water
yes well i haven't known about that but
um um
i mean over geological times they should
actually migrate although maybe
less so because the way that tidal
locking happens
is it's kind of a friction effect that's
happening on the planet
the planet gets distended we actually
have an episode oh actually sorry the
episode just came out last week
we had an episode recently discussing
all this so i won't repeat myself on
that but
the planet's kind of being broken into a
cycle of one orbit for one tide
by being pulled so it's possible that
all the continents would stay locked in
place at that point
but you could potentially have
continental drift move things around and
potentially cause something like that
um for that matter if you have enough
ice it's possible you can have a cold
just on top of glacials even it's just a
little bit of dust or
volcanism deposits a little bit nutrient
up there life is surprisingly adaptive
and uh
if you've got motion on the planet it's
going to try to adapt i should think but
uh it depends what you mean by life
there's a microbiologist sitting in the
room right now by the way so um she
could probably
say better than i could you get weird
extreme ohio showing up and they do live
in glaciers we found them everywhere we
have lakes
underneath antarctica that have had life
in them so even if we don't have
continents drifting you're going to have
motion on that planet and life in those
zones that's going to have to adapt
that's a that was a wonderful question
yeah very neat
so now using weather control on
megastructures
how close could you get completely
contrasting environments
like having a desert or a tundra right
next to each other
i mean there's nothing really stopping
you depending on how artificial you want
to be with it once you
leave aside trying to go for natural and
there's nothing natural about like an
onion solo
you could just go ahead and have a
membrane of something like a glass
between two layers that uh was mostly
designed to confine the humidity
you could do forced air walls like you
see when you go into stores the bigger
stores in the wintertime up up north
where we have ice and snow
they have uh what's called an aerocarton
which is basically a blower that blows
really strong to keep
the separation of corn hot always messes
up my hair yeah yeah
but uh you know that that sort of thing
could allow you to create
two really really different environments
within spain distance each other
um you know your light control doesn't
have to be one big omnidirectional light
like ours is
it can be a long strip uh running down
the axe of that cylinder it can be
you can change the light spectra you can
make it so certain areas were very
bright in the green frequencies
others were very bright in the red
others were mostly infrared you know
you have so many options to change
things around that you could pack them
in pretty tight
i don't know if you could do what we
call the microplanet our rick and morty
where they had the planet there they
zoomed into it with their ship and the
ship smacked into it
because they didn't realize the plant
was that close it was all about the size
of a football field
but uh you know theoretically with some
of those smaller habitats you could get
biomes that were disgustingly tiny with
macroscopic credits in them
next question so how would you grapple
an asteroid
to swing from it and change your
trajectory if it's mostly gravel
carefully um when you shoot an asteroid
that's mostly made out of gravel you're
going to have the effect of spalling
even worse than when you normally hit
some piece of space debris at a high
speed
um so carefully your tether is
it depends on how fast you're going you
can't turn too fast this is a mistake
folks make sometimes when we think about
orbits
say what is the turning radius around
earth uh
you know it depends on your speed and
the tony radius mean orbiting right
above earth is the
actual orbital speed that we go at
that's why you have no gravity on board
you are
experiencing one g of torn or 0.99 strew
up a little bit of other planet
and um you need a very long tether to
swing at that kind of speed then too
you need one that was 6 000 kilometers
long in order to
grapple something while you're moving 11
kilometers a second or eight kilometers
a second in terms of direction
uh without smashing yourself against
your own hole
um so in a way your tether has to be
pretty long to begin with for it to be
no
useful um but with them being made
mostly out of gravel uh
i'm not really sure why you try to swing
that way though um you can
get things into them pretty deep and
they're not all crab or some of them are
pretty hard metals
um even then you can you know if you've
ever
tried to put a stake in the sand or
gravel before you if you pound in pretty
tight it's not moving much anywhere
uh it's it's held there pretty tightly
so you should be able to do it but i
don't think it's a maneuver you should
really be trying to do much
and ashtray me to sand that'd be a sight
to see
it's actually i think like i thought of
them that are basically just
they will see silicon that's just saying
yeah that's they're they're
called quartz in some cases but actually
almost all the rocks are silicon oxygen
so they're almost all same
i'm learning next question so do you
think there is an alien species
that already know of our existence no
um i mean again the usual thing on this
is we have no way of knowing but
if they are older than us and they live
anywhere nearby us like in this galaxy
um and they're technological and yeah
they know about us they knew about us
before we
we knew about ourselves uh because you
don't have to find
radio signals to find a planet you can
find traces of its
you know frequently high concentrations
of oxygen in its atmosphere
which really should not occur there
might be natural processes that would
give you high
concentrations of oxygen in an
atmosphere but um
you'd still probably go and investigate
each single one of those you know oxygen
should not be floating around in the
atmosphere it should be reacting
chemically and getting some
found into the iron they should have
known about us before we were walking
out the
out of the jungles they should have
known about us before and you know
however old they were
plus whatever the light lag is their
planet some ten thousand or hundred
thousand years away it is
that's what they knew about us you know
and uh
it's just very improbable they wouldn't
know about us whether or not they exist
is the question then but if they do
exist
yeah they know we're here you can't hide
either at that point too because
astronomy is history
you can't shut your radio beacons off
now you know they already hold them
no place to hide no place to hide
i have a question now if nasa announces
they have
ftl drive where do you want to send the
probe first
outside of our own solar system
i guess it would depend on what the
distances involved we tend to assume
even with most ftl drives that
closer is still easier that's a bit
debatable like the rqbr warp drive
uh theoretically you could go at
intergalactic velocities
uh very quickly up to hundreds of
thousands of light years a second
potentially
in which case the place you go to are
the most interesting ones to go to like
you go to the
nearest black hole take the measurements
nearest neutron star
but alpha centauri is is a very
interesting system it is the closest
although arguably proxima which is the
close one might not be part of that
system we just tend to assume it was
um but uh go visit that one because it
does have a lot of interesting stuff
going on to it but
serious be serious a um
tau seti uh and most of the trappist
systems that are near enough to be
visible we
find ones go to but
next question do you think we will
eventually subclassify
m b type stars due to the massive range
of stars those classes cover
also how prized would giant stars like
regal
be for colonization very uh we have an
episode that's on that at the end of the
upcoming month uh colonizing giant star
as well you know there's this notion
that you shouldn't colonize the big ones
because you're gonna go boom
um and basically i'm not gonna spoil the
episode because it's coming out this
month
uh so you can watch it then but we will
challenge that assumption that you
wouldn't want to colonize these
highly explosive and short-lived stars
and rather that they will be the most
valuable ones out there
um as for just the the m type stars in
the first place the vege wars the ones
that make up most the stars now that we
know better
um you know i'm telling you whether we
include brown dwarfs um
so i got strapped up on my cat walking
through all the vials for the cameras
he's a cutie yeah it's an annoying
moment though focusing what if he
trips and knocks them all over
m type stars the red ones uh
they really should be broken into at
least a few categories i'd say but the
the big one would be the ones are going
to go in the blue dwarves those ones
under a quarter of a solar mass and
those though bigger
um that probably should be two separate
classes but
i don't know they'll bother me doing
that truth be told the color spectrum
ones your
m k g o a i'm sharing them say these are
the order i think they go this was it
o b a f
a l a o b f
a k g o well which of the case happens b
uh there's a there is a no doesn't
matter there's
some one of those oh golly oh boy
nah doesn't matter move you along
how long i don't think those ones will
even stick them out as a system of
classification much local
well here's a talking about the future
how likely is it that far
future will be terrible how can we
reduce
s-risk i.e risks of extreme suffering in
the far
future um you know sometimes the thing
about the future is not to try to solve
all the problems that are in the future
um we talk about colony arc ships that
are going to be traveling through space
for potentially thousands of years or
thousands of generations
uh that we have the question of how do
we make sure those people stay on the
same target in all the same society when
they arrive after all those generations
and i think that people don't ask too
much is is it really our business to be
doing that
do you want someone who's been dead for
a thousand years let alone a thousand
generations do you want their core dead
hand around your neck
telling you what to do whatever the
motives are no matter how good they are
um i generally don't believe that folks
who live centuries ago
understand our situation any better than
we do right now because i don't think
there are smallness per se i don't think
they're done with us that's a mistake
don't
think that folks in the past is dumb but
they weren't any smarter than us
and uh they didn't have the information
we have
you know it's hard to predict a century
ahead of time what the problem is going
to be
um you know i think with the most famous
science fiction series the foundation by
my namesake as
asimov um great series love it uh but
if i had been the foundation leaders i
would have gotten smashed up the uh
the hologram thing within a fourth
century having i don't want him to
you know guide your future good oil we
can do it on our own and whatever he
knew
we should know and understand better so
the same thing that applies the future
is
i don't want to create a system or a
world where all the problems are solved
because
then they don't have anything to do and
what's more my solution probably isn't
going to have been a good one
and if they are the sense of us who are
worthy of of the
the honors at war um assuming they don't
view us with contempt but whichever case
happens to be
they should be able to handle their own
problems we don't want to leave problems
on them but
i think it's our job to try to solve
them all for them either
if that makes sense i think we got time
for one more question before we go to
the break
alrighty last question before break what
do you think about the younger driest
event
and could it have wiped out an advanced
civilization on earth
i'm trying to know the younger driest
event was the one from like twelve
thousand years ago or seventy thousand
years ago
um i know one was the one that's thought
to have emptied out the
uh not the black sea obviously but above
drained the black sea a little bit and
the other was the impact event that was
about 70 000 years ago um
and what was the actual question
attached that again so do you think it
would have wiped out an advanced
civilization on earth oh no
no i mean it may be it could have
knocked over some ones that were pretty
close but
and of course we have that with the um i
can't what they're called right now that
they would probably actually call that
the the
indus valley civilization it starts with
an h um
but uh that was around there like five
thousand years ago very advanced in many
ways they like bricks and standard
templates for a lot of stuff
same for a lot of things we haven't
pop-up but they didn't really stick
around um
and i don't think they really lost
technology that often civilizations fall
they don't tend to use
you know whatever technology is used for
sticks around so usually they use things
like aqueducts because they're not doing
aqueducts anymore but
i don't think civilizations tend to be
the first things to fall when
um when you have rough times because
they're the most robust in many ways
the weakest two but they'll pop back up
within a generation a lot of times in
some new format
all right we're gonna go ahead and head
to break and we'll see you in a little
bit
we'll be on break for a few minutes
while i refresh my coffee and it's a
great time to grab a drink and a snack
yourself or get some more questions into
our chat
you've probably noticed my wife and
usual co-host sarah is not present today
she's attending a friend's wedding and
congratulations to robin and holly
knisley
instead we're joined today by someone
who was a groomsman in my own wedding
a longtime friend of sarah and i david
thomas who also happens to be the
ashbeela county auditor having gotten
elected divorce in 2018
at the age of 25 i've known david since
he was in his teen serving on the zoning
board of austin brook township one town
over for mine
and he spent much of the time in between
at college and working in state and
federal government positions
with the state legislature and u.s
congress he came home after that to
serve as austin brooks fiscal officer
while working on his mba
and then was elected county otto and is
our youngest elected county official
he has definitely brought a lot of
enthusiasm and technical knowledge to
the post
and one of his more interesting
adaptations during the covet 19 crisis
was posting videos discussing taxes and
regulations while simultaneously hosting
a cooking show from his kitchen home
which are probably the most interesting
discussions of topics like prop
evaluation and taxes
in existence i often like to use our
monthly live stream break to highlight
one of the many folks who help out on
the show
and i want to thank david for taking the
time to guest co-host today
i've mentioned before how lucky i've
been over the years and folks i've
gotten to call friend
many with the show and many locally over
my time in college or the military
and this last year when we often haven't
gotten to spend as much time with our
friends as we are used to
it helps to remind us how much we should
appreciate all those folks in our life
they can't help out in tough times even
just by being there
and i hope you got some folks like that
in your own life
that's an interesting note on futurism
someone commented to me not too long
back how things like social media were
never expected on the internet when the
concept was new
and this may be true but is an example
of how we probably should have seen that
developing
because technology is something we use
to enhance our lives and further our
goals and priorities
and humans are innately social critters
so it stands to reason that any
technology that can't be used
in that way will tend to be once someone
thinks a way to do so
on our channel related note before we
get back to the show we recently altered
our format on patreon to switch to a
monthly donation system
something patreon offered as one of
their two principal donation methods for
years
but we have always done the other one
the pro creation or
per thing option and patreon has been
encouraging us to switch for a while
to add additional functionality and we
finally have the transition appears to
have gone quite smoothly but i want to
thank all of our patrons for their
continued support
and patience during that switch i used
to use the pro thingy option because i
didn't think it was right to charge
folks unless the video had come out
but i'd only do it for the regular
thursday episode which is why i always
afford the extra episodes that came out
occasionally as bonus episodes
uh they began as a bit of an extra thank
you or bonus to those patrons as i
didn't charge for that episode
since we are switching to monthly and we
have gotten to the regular habit of
doing an extra episode mid month on
sundays
and the end of the month live stream i
started mentally switching to thinking
of those mid-month bonus episodes as
sci-fi sundays
as the bonus episodes tend to be more
relaxed science fiction discussion type
episodes
like our star trek prime directive fermi
paradox episode of a couple months back
this month's machine overlords episode
or the one for february
career of the inhabitation which is
probably about as close as where we'll
get to doing the often requested sexy
aliens episode for the alien
civilization series
and we will be looking at both how you'd
build a space station or habitat with
multiple alien species living in it
and how alien human marriages or half
alien half-human folks might come to be
and speaking of marriages
congratulations again to robert and
hawley on their happy day
and thanks again to david thomas for
filling in for my wife sarah while she
attends their wedding
with all that said let's get back to our
show
back okay so we are ready for more
questions yes and i will now say who the
questions from so i apologize for those
folks previously
so question from cluckery duckery that's
a fun name
what would you think is the rough
timeline for us to start having
civilizations living and working
in space on a large scale do you think
it's centuries years decades
i mean it kind of depends on what we
mean by large scale here we will have
people walking in space
within 20 years ago
probably have hundreds of people looking
at they're up there at a given time
sometime this century it should be in
the hundreds
uh at a given time this century whether
it's in the thousands
they're actually at any given time
walking up there this century is hard to
say
assume thousands of people are going to
go into space
uh in a given year in in the not judaism
future maybe in the next decade or two
but probably more like 20 years from now
after that it's just when do we hit that
snowball when do we get that point that
um you can make a profit doing something
in space
um and uh i think that
that time is still going to be a bit far
ahead
even then a lot of the stuff you can
make money on like mining an asteroid
that can be probably a lot better done
by a robot so he wouldn't necessarily
have a big crew up there
but he have a lot of folks in orbit
maybe maybe robots in space more
so next question is from the hebrew
barrister well this is a great one
would you rather fight one horse-sized
duck or 10 duck-sized horses
what i'm going to assume you mean by
that question is with a combat robot
that was horse-sized
uh have an advantage over 10 duck-sized
combat drones so
um and uh to answer the more actual
question because uh
of the family farm we have ducks and
horses uh i would rather
get in a fight with ten ducks than a
given horse i also hate ducks because
one built me at the building when i was
a kid at galfield park down in minotaur
um a really nice duck pond there uh
celebrating our president garfield was
from this area
and i used to go feed the ducks there
they had little bread machines for you
to do that and they bit me and i hate
ducks because they're eggies
ducks are good for eating that's right
yes that's that's right yeah
next question is from augusto ascoti
what happens if a gamma-ray
burst from a nearby supernova hit the
sun hit also
oh off a lot of nothing an awful lot of
nothing there's a lot of gamma
i mean if it was a full-on highly
focused beam that was transferring all
the energy that thing had somehow
via like a wormhole yes it would heat
the sopping off a lot and some would go
hotter for a while as a result but
realistically it barely had the effect
same as if i if the whole sun went
supernova
um it wouldn't even destroy jupiter
weights a good portion of subway
atmosphere
um saturn would still be around um
it's even vaguely possible you might
have something of pluto left behind just
because it's far away but it's mostly
ice ball
the supernovas are incredibly powerful
but they still have to
obey the inverse square law next
question is from alexander
padukchev how easy would it be for a
rogue group to go off and establish a
rogue colony
for example the origins of the romulans
from star trek
you know i'm not up enough on most
recent canon changes to know what the
origins the romulans were i know they in
the vulcans had broken apart at some
point in the past
um but uh i i suppose it depends on
which candidate is
um the ability to revoke colony it just
depends on how good your spaceships are
and how um centralized whoever's running
the show feels like being because it is
really easy to blow up
uh an outbound spaceship you cannot
escape a star system
uh unless unless you've got way more
guns than the other guy has is too easy
blows
solid ships you cannot run away it
doesn't even matter if your engines are
faster
because and here's the big one if
they're running on fuel you have to use
fuel to slow down
they on the other hand if they're
pursuing you can use that fuel to speed
up because they don't need to stop they
just need to hit you and the faster they
hit you the more damage they cost
so um there is no way to escape a solar
system to go off and form a road colony
if they're actively trying to stop you
from doing it on the other hand if
you're just taking spaceships out into
stellar space you can change course once
you're out there and so forth
then yeah you know if you can find an
empty place it depends on how far you
want to sail there are
billions and billions of empty solar
systems in this galaxy
and but the right technology could
potentially head that colony all the way
off into galactic space too
next question is from dylan isaac do you
place de laires
um only a little bit stellaris is i like
paradox
as a game company they tend to make some
of the best games and sloths is one of
those and everyone's huge fan of it on
the show too and
i love the music from it too but i
haven't played it that much or anything
else of much of late i tend to play
games though
fairly old that i know really well like
the back of my hand when i play games at
all anymore
um i hate to say it but i tend to spend
most of that part of my
interest in creativity writing scripts
these days instead so
next question is the gosh game though
next question is from josh karen uh what
are your thoughts on the government
creating a ufo
task force
i think they already had in the past i'm
trying to remember what it's called um
i should probably emphasize there's a
tendency to assume that like the air
force or nasa have these
ufo sightings and they never pay
attention to them and they hold very
secret meetings but
at least to the best of my knowledge and
i actually know some folks who have had
occasion to work involved with such
things in the past
um they tend to be just as interested as
everybody else and they don't tend to
make two assumptions one way or another
um
and uh i'm always for forming these but
i don't expect them to find
intelligent aliens i expect them to find
interesting new phenomena like how ball
lightning works or
what new uh was it what new strange ship
our enemies or rivals or nominal
allies have come up with or in many
cases probably what new prototype we've
come up with that their department was
not supposed to know about and get an
angry letter from whoever does know
about that saying please stop reporting
our test flights that's ours so
i suppose that's space force
next question is from canadian isaac
what is your opinion on universal
language
currency measuring system universal
language currency measurement system
i have to i don't actually know what
that is i'm afraid we're going to have
to uh
to to pass on that one for now if you
want to leave that one in the comments
section
because that sounds like an interesting
thing to know about i will try to get
back to that later on sorry
so next question is from buddhist bot
would interstellar spacecraft be
configured
like a traditional rocket or would they
be configured like the valkyrie designed
by charles pellegrino
um the valkyrie by pellegrino if i
remember it right
was a ship thought up in the 90s that
used antimatter as its rocket fuel
and it's theoretically the fastest
rocket you can make because it's using
pure matted energy conversion
theoretically it could get up to very
close to speed of light
um and of course there's that whole
anti-matter issues here episode
anti-matter factories in the uses
for reasons why that's maybe not the
best choice of rocket fuel
um but uh i tend to think of you trying
to get things up above 10 of light speed
um
i don't think you ever find a way to
mass produce and store anti-metal
stupidly cheap
compared to just turning a laser beam on
a ship that's got sales and pushing it
that way
so um but i mean it's still the basic
same rocket design of them and obviously
antimatter is going to be entirely
different in terms of nozzles you got to
use
magnetic fields for instance for your
nozzles there you can't be using metal
but
we're already moving outside that zone
anyway we just don't have things that
can handle that kind of temperature and
you always want your rocket engine as
hot as possible
that's the key to getting efficiency out
of them doesn't matter what the material
is you're shooting out the back
hot rockets not well yes exactly
next question isaac from cal and he
asked simply
simpsons or futurama
um you know i don't watch the simpsons
anymore i was a huge fan of simpsons up
through about season 15.
um and i just stopped it doesn't even
watching the rebounds these days don't
do much for me
futurama i do love the show and i i'm
not knocking simpsons it was
amazing the time i just i think it got
old for me i liked futurama but i was
never actually a huge future around fan
of the fourth season
too either and i feel like treacher was
saying that but i used to joke the
future on was the most scientifically
realistic of shows in many ways
but in much the same way that warhammer
40k is it's
ridiculous in so many things but
occasionally narrows some stuff on their
head
um and but i would say probably futurama
i'd say rick and morty though for
anyone's one of my favorite cartoonists
these days this next question is from
technological singularity with animal
gupta
hi isaac my question to you is why can't
people use the money time and resources
for saving earth
instead of searching for potentially
habitable
exoplanets um
i mean we can walk and shoot bubble gum
at the same time as the is the usual
answer anyway
you cannot throw money at problems that
are scientific
and expect them to get solid faster just
by throwing money at them it does help a
bit
you know there's a lot of people there
are things where just tossing money at
the bottom does tend to speed things up
a bit
i'm going to a degree um people get
interested in sciences for a variety of
reasons and you can't
be like hey all you guys who are
interested in geology and biology and
medical science we're going to stuff you
at
the issue of recycling garbage and all
of you are interested in physics and
astronomy
you too only get in on that issue and
we'll throw as much money away as you
want
you can pump up the research and field a
lot by doing that but only to a very
limited degree
on the other hand you're going to start
missing out on stuff you know physics
for instance is that baseline science
same as math where
advances in it tend to spoil advances in
other fields um
we you know the new microscope that
comes out has to be built around new
principles you're going to find in
optics or in physics
um if you stop doing that where's your
new discoveries coming from that are
actually letting them
advance those areas so it's not just a
question of can we walk and chew
bubblegum at the same time
it's the question of can we do anything
but that
we have to you know we have to keep at
these things we have to multitask
and there are there are almost 8 billion
of us now almost 8 billion
we should be able to do more a few
things at once you know so
that would be my thought on that next
question is from void
and yes i've heard fusion reactors are
more efficient than stars
could the lack of dyson spheres be
because anyone with a time and resources
to make one
just star lifts it all to reactors
instead
that can be the reason why there would
be dyson spheres or dyson swarms itself
the the idea of the dyson swarm is if
you've got a starboard in there you're
gonna go and globe it with a bunch of
other
power collectors to make sure you use
all that energy if you are not using
them for power then you should see the
normal stall
problem is if you rip them apart you are
now going to use them to
presumably make energy with a commercial
fusion reactor or
even dumping the matter down black hole
say generating power for black holes you
can make a black hole is easy
that's like the easiest power system in
the world for advanced amount of energy
conversion is
dump the stuff down a black hole and
absorb the radiation that comes out
um and it's ultra efficient um
and it still leaves your heat signature
and that's the critical thing there
biological systems are going to be
somewhere between 273 kelvin and 300
some kelvin that's just how it's going
to be if they're based on water um
and that's probably gonna be the most
common type of life out there because
it's hard to cover the way it could not
be
right uh and so they should have their
environment showing up at about that
temperature
whatever they're doing that they're
living in should be around that
temperature
and thus we should see infrared from
whatever power sourcing off in that zone
coming off
they could be spiking other regions they
might be post human post biological they
might exist at 37 kelvin
370 or whatever it is um and then they'd
be a lot cooler but they'd still be
spiking
in a specific you know band of
frequencies that we can't account for
and that's basically the notion of what
dyson study is
is trying to find the waste heat of a
civilization
that we say it has to do with dyson
swarms is just that that's the first
thing we would think that we would
probably tend to do
um but it doesn't change that you're
looking for their waste heat that's
dysonian seti
and basically a dyson sphere is about
absorbing the energy of a star
but it doesn't have to be a dyson sphere
it could be just a whole bunch of really
big reactors that are relatively close
together because people don't like to
spend
a thousand years traveling back and
forth to see their neighbor and they
don't like to spend
100 years sending a message to their
cousin they clustered together
right as close as they can and that
gives you that dense
and bright frequency of whatever that
waste heat is
that's the extent of it so it doesn't
matter if they're using stars or not
that'd be a pretty important message 100
years
[Laughter]
so you got clarification books overdue
compound interest
[Laughter]
yeah clarification from canadian and
isaac what is your opinion on going to
universal language currency measuring
systems they clarified and said only
using one language
one currency okay one measuring system
okay
um you know way back like two years ago
was doing the the pretty new on these
ones we had a lot of typos come through
somebody asked me uh
they meant to ask what a vacuum rocket
would look like but it came off as a
uh was a vacuum raccoon
and i was trying to figure out what that
was forever today um
switching to a single single system of
measurements switching to a single
system
of language there's a lot to be said
about standardization i hate the metric
system i think i've mentioned that to
people in the past
metric system is horrible and everything
people tell me that's actually a pretty
good system but
people's assumption that we should only
use metric system is just lazy thinking
it really is
um scientists are not all in favor of
using the metric system
otherwise it wouldn't have units like ev
or light years
a year is not metric the other thing is
say well i like using base unit 10
that's not the metric system as a
decimal system right and
it tends not on natural numbers we have
ten fingers we also have 12 knuckles
most well counting systems are based on
12 in the past because it's 3 times 4 is
12
6 times 2 is 12 1 divided by 2 etc uh
whereas 10 you've got 5 divided by 2. we
do not naturally do ten
we could do twelve we do six we use base
five
and twelve get sixty minutes in an hour
or sixty seconds in a minute
six five times twelve right um
but other than that little rant about
these things getting confused as i have
a bit of a passion against it
the metro system is a very handy one for
day-to-day stuff but it's not in any way
special unique
and it's not the best one to be using if
i'm trying to do astronomy
um it's not the best one to be using if
i'm trying to do
anything smaller than uh you know the
human skill really
uh it's very good for day to day stuff
um it is not good for
even involving particle physics for
instance where we never use it
and it's the same for languages right
it's good to have a language everyone
could speak together
anything about the moment that seems to
be english is the lingo francois
as opposed to french which was the
previous lingard franco or latin
right uh maybe it'd be arabic or spanish
one day more likely it'd be some huge
portamento of every major
trade language in play and those are
handy um but
do you need to eliminate all your
languages there's a lot of thinking
advantages to having
you know being bilingual well there's a
lot of thinking advantages to having
more than one unit of measure you use
too
a lot of mistakes i've seen when people
are learning physics know or learning
chemistry or other things is they forget
to carry their units to them
and they do that more and it's only in
metric because you don't have to all
these are the same there's just one
um when you actually have to convert
units a lot it reminds you to carry
those around more and you make less
mistakes
in my experience my anecdotal experience
uh by knowing multiple units and being
comfortable with them
as to what the best unit of measure is
well it certainly isn't the imperial
system feeding yours is not great so i
guess it is metric by default but
don't get too rude to the idea that one
system of language or one system of
currency or one system of measurement
is going to fix any problems it can be
handy you certainly want standardization
but
computers can standardize things
automatically so
it's not necessarily as important as it
used to be either
diversity is the spice of life all right
i'm going to get in so much trouble for
that answer to people
yeah it's the metric system when your
base unit is a kilogram
g1 thousand grams you got a bad system
[Laughter]
so next question is from rahmael daniel
of videl soto
what do you think about the argument
that humanoid aliens are more energy
efficient
than any other theoretical anatomy that
humanoid aliens are
more energy efficient than any other
theoretical anatomy
um you know that comes up in sci-fi a
lot of times as
what i've always thought of as a
rationalization for why your special
effects buzzer can only handle putting
humans on the screen or humanoids people
who look like humans only they got a
little
forehead or ear difference for or some
random crack cream that mouth which
seems to be a popular one
um it's expensive to do special effects
um there are a lot of advantages to the
bipedal system
uh and there's almost nothing that you
subside humans that i can think of
um more limbs you got especially the
bigger you are the harder it's going to
be to control them we use a lot of our
brain just for controlling our limbs and
things like that so
uh i would not expect the humanoid form
to be less common but i can't think of
any particular reason it's more power
efficient
it's very good at getting a bit of heat
though um i don't know that's really
unique to our geometry
but humans are much better getting rid
of heat than most other mammals and
that's a good advantage for us
personally but that's compared to other
mammals who all use basically the same
you know basic anatomy that we do i i
would say that the best thing for
getting you out of heat
is uh not a sphere the less feel like it
is the better is it when you get heat so
it's got like a million little
stegosaurus things popping out the back
of his fins
and actually i think there's been talk
about whether dinosaurs might use those
and sometimes this way it's radiant heat
um the more radiating heat systems you
got the better you are getting rid of
heat and we're not really that good at
radiating heat you know you could
have an extra clean fans things like
that extra spikes
but maybe humanoid system would be i
would not be surprised to find other
humanoid aliens if we found
aliens but i wouldn't assume that would
be the norm either
next question is from hannah b is there
a material that's scarce enough and hard
enough to make in a post-scarcity
civilization
that it could function as a currency
similarly to the gold standard
um well there's two questions packed in
that one the first is
uh is there that material the second you
know that is there something besides
gold
and then the other question that's
packed in there is kind of the
assumption that a commodity currency can
be a good thing
um then potentially it can we could
argue that what we currently use fiat
currency is a commodity currency of
stability it's based off the stability
of the country that's issuing that coins
um but uh commodity currencies of any
kind always are very very vulnerable
to uh anything technological that
changes the production system so
let's say i'm making some alloy that is
a hyper strong never decays metal that
people
just cannot realistically forge unless
they've got themselves
something like a neutron star and black
hole factory returning out that alloy
and there are some
weird things you might be able to make
out of like quark metal or mag matter
that we've
looked at conceptually that might be
things you could only manufacture inside
giant super colliders but uh let's say
that's the case someone invents a way to
do that 10 more efficiently
and besides the fact that they are
conjuring right out the get-go from
having done that
everybody else's money is now worth 10
less um
and uh that can be quite a problem
because of course some people have debts
that are now worth ten percent less of
the people savings are worth 10 less et
cetera
that's the kind of problem we have
almost any commodity currency which they
have their advantages too but
the best small process in the 1900s that
made steel suddenly 1
7 the price it had been on the market
that allowed us to do
railroads that allowed us to do
skyscrapers because it was something
cheap to make steel
uh if your currents have been based on
steel at that time
you probably wouldn't have a chance to
build any railroads because that would
be too busy fighting boards each other
trying to collect
on various debts you know so i don't
think that we
can make too many assumptions about what
kind of special materials we might find
like the island of stability
things with 140 or so uh protons in the
atoms things like that we don't know
uh we might make all sorts of weird
stuff out of the other four quarks
besides the up and down quark your
charm strange top and bottom or truth
and booty corks
we might find that we can make survival
dark matter that's our episode for two
weeks from now
there might be all sorts of strange
things we make through awesome i don't
think it'll be a good idea to make a
currency out of them unless you've been
using them for so long everyone was
really confident that after a million
years of having that thing no one's
going to
improve it better so that'd be my
thought on that one
next question is from costas have you
read any warhammer 40k novels
um you know i was going to say easier to
say which ones i haven't read but they
actually all hundreds and hundreds of
them there's a whole bunch of them on
the let me
point that thing down well there's not
that name on there they're on the shelf
right they have the light on it
oh
he's got a lot of math books yeah but um
uh most of them on audiobook too uh
which is why it's very nice to be a
member of audible because they're much
cheaper
um but uh let's see
um uh
it's a great setting for just strange
thoughts in general it has some bizarre
realism to it but i don't know i just
think it's funny as heck for the most
part
uh i'm a fan of 40k but uh
i would not say it's terribly realistic
scientifically speaking
at awful next question is from mario
could the black hole just be a super
dense object like a neutron star
but it is so much more dense that does
not allow for light to escape
but it would remain the same object
nonetheless
yeah there's a lot of unknowns about
black holes and it doesn't have to be
that dense either
um in order for something to the the the
density a black hole needs to be a black
hole
uh goes down the more mass of it is and
the event horizon one of those its
radius expands linear to mass so if you
double a black hole's mass
it doubles its actual uh event horizon
radius or eight times more volume
which means eighth the density for that
same amount
right um or quarter of that 60 double
the mass
um black holes in the center of galaxies
have huge event horizons and the mass
inside them could be very undense
um you need to get really dense to make
tiny ones
um but not so dense for other ones right
um
so if they are not single point like
objects and that's very debated
then you could potentially have ones
that were no denser than ar
and uh like the bulch plants we talk
about where we stuff an entire galaxy
into something you build a shell around
it
the big big brother of the dyson sphere
um those things are insanely undensed
they are
less dense than the space the space
station is going through
and the others would still be a black
hole right underneath the ground layer
so it varies a bit
next question is from melancholy if we
had heavily invested
in nuclear propulsion and continued
investing in space
in 1960s and 70s how far along do you
think we would be today
um that's a good question though coming
back real quick to the previous one i
should have finished that was saying we
don't know if a black hole has to be a
point-like object or not the event
horizon is not the same as the
singularity that's inside or the plank
style whatever the density might be the
centaur
we don't really have too many details on
that because we don't have a full amount
of quantum gravity yet so there's a lot
of ifs
and a lot of uncertainties on those so
it's really hard to investigate because
the s1 is thousands of light years away
and you die if you stuck your head down
so um
the question was uh what was it nuclear
propulsion if we had invested
um and continued investing in the 60s
and 70s where we'd be today
if we'd invested in nuclear power
properly
um and that
is good to be safe with technologies i
am not on the side of
the nuclear advocates who feel like
we've regulated completely out of
out of any just proportion but we have
overdone it right
but it was right to be cautious too
maybe we got a bit overboard but
at the same time if we have been
properly researching developing nuclear
technologies uh especially propulsion
for
not on use on this planet or in orbit
but for
things between plants or even on the
moon we would be way further ahead of
that
and we'd be a lot further ahead in
trying to have
sources of power that don't run on dead
dinosaurs um
although of course they're very few
probably dinosaurs but
next question from blueberry lane is
there a way to know how much material
you could get from a mantle or mojo mine
like you described your colonizing the
oceans video
uh emojo mine what is that we have
mispronounced the mohave
discontinuity which is basically the
edge of the
of the mantle and the crust there the
planet the idea there would be that you
if you stick a big straw down into the
uh through the
crunchy exterior of the plant you could
suck out it's juicy
um i think the first time i saw the word
moho mine was in a game called total
annihilation that came out about in the
late 90s but the same time starcraft
came out and i loved that game
um and you had mohumei instead basically
that was an entire setup where the two
sides were
ripping the entire plants apart for the
purpose of killing each other there was
no other reason the fact that they just
been fighting for centuries that they
really want to see if it got dead
not a lot of plot there um but the uh
mines theoretically should let you apart
just tons and tons and tons of metal how
much you could pull out would be very
much based on at what point do you think
you're trying to mine might collapse
but you should have it refilling pretty
quickly the trick is how you get the
material back up there and
mostly how you actually managed to
getting kind of stable shaft down there
because
at that point even a lot of the
materials we think it was very hard and
solid to start acting more like a liquid
so it's tricky
but gigatons worth of stuff at least
it'd be way more productive than say a
asteroid mine or a moon mine there is
more rocky material in all mantle than
on our core than
the rest of the solar system mass the
gas giants combined it's about the same
amount
so a lot of stuff here right in the
ocean well
well by the percent of the planet most
of which is covered by the ocean but
it's it's
thinner by the ocean it's easier to get
there
and blows up less value for stuff it
spills out
that's true next question is from
voyager of time
the great oxidation event created most
of the oxygen on earth and forced
bacteria to adjust to it
do you think genetically engineered
bacteria that sounds scary
will be used for terraforming planets i
hope so that would be awesome
um i i love genetically engineering
things as a concept
uh i want to have trees that grow bacon
um
which healthy bacon would be really
horrifying to think about what the sap
probably would be
maple syrup already made
for trains it's all local area they're
one of the big economies we have locally
is we grow people with crops
um i think that uh you know the key
is is it's so much easier to work with
bacteria than trying to you know
create large macroscopic organisms that
have been gene tailored to something
like a marsh environment
but yeah yeah i think you probably would
use a lot of bacteria to be using that
because
but there's also that blowy kind of
range you like bacteria because once you
get the right one there all you have to
sit there is wait patiently and add fuel
and there'll be a contribution of things
but then
whatever the doubling time to that
number of power orders is
um you get tiny machines though that are
self-replicating and
they're also giving you a very thin and
blurry line between what would qualify
as say
a bacteria and what would qualify as a
universal assembler machine
and maybe it's so blurry that it doesn't
actually matter what distinction is
you'll be using one or the other of
those the terraform plants you want to
do with that style of ecology
and i'm not sure there really is a one
or the other
at that point in time because again very
blurry line but yeah
lots of genetically engineered microbes
in the future and possibly bacon trees
one of those sounds tasty so
next question is from gadfly and this
person's asking
the right question isaac do you take
your coffee black or with cream
they're betting on black um i don't take
it black anymore i've been drinking
coffee since i was four
he's quite the coffee fiend look who's
talking i know
it's like the only coffee stop was to me
in the county um
i used to take it black all the time in
the military until when the doctors told
me that i should probably
stop uh then i later scored cold brew
coffee so i probably could give a
drinking black again but i
actually take it with uh cream of
sugar's night now these days i take the
queen shoe i used to get black
um all right we've got time for one more
question and then we'll go ahead and
call it quits for today
all right this question is from
alexander isaac are individual asteroids
actually worth
quintillions of dollars if so why hasn't
anybody been rushing to get their hands
on this cache
uh atypical mountain has a small mass
range like what typical asteroid is the
same size
when was the last time there were a
million mountains on this planet like a
million of them
when was the last time you heard anyone
rush out to buy one it's got the metals
inside though they are they are
probably billions of dollars if not
trillions of dollars worth of iron in
your typical mountain or
core or i have no idea what they even
keep inside the mountains
rocks there are valuable rocks inside
them i'm not a geologist
but it's going to be a different ones
than we have in these asteroids be sure
um there's a lot you can mine out of
them the idea was you might be able to
get easy access to a lot of heavier
elements that would tend to settle so
you might have
gold platinum things like that that are
readily accessible in relatively small
asteroids you have to dig really deep to
find this stuff will luck out on a vein
but the other value of things like
asteroids is that we don't have to drag
them out of a really powerful gravity
well to use them in space that's why
we're interested in their steel or their
ions today
is we can more cheaply drag
make a ton of iron back from the
asteroid belt 100 million miles away
then we can drag that same amount of
stuff up from our atmosphere
through our atmosphere orbit just 100
miles away so a million times further
for
half the price or less you know it's
going to be where you start sourcing
that stuff from
but that's the same as a concept there's
nothing in the asteroids that isn't on
earth then there is more of earth than
there are those asteroids
but we have to live on top of offense
sometimes really difficult to dig
underneath and people don't always like
you doing so
you know we would say rare earth
elements they're not rare we all the
elements aren't even vaguely
they're all over the planet um but they
are incredibly
toxic when you try to mine and refine
them people don't really want to do that
if you can produce them up in space and
bring them back you're ready to go
maybe that economy changes a little bit
so but
the thing is we're not really interested
in asteroid mining or moon mining for
bringing stuff home to earth other than
gold and platinum and other things that
are maybe more easily or abundantly
acquired out there and brought back here
western mining space to more cheaply get
stuff
into space so we're not spending a
thousand dollars a kilogram and how the
stuff up there you know
so that's that's the real value of those
there i'm sorry i missed a lot of
people's questions today
uh and we'll be back again in about a
month uh with sarah can we join
us i want to thank david thomas again
for helping us out today and if you do
have any questions if you want to leave
in the comments the video i will try to
get back to them
later today or tomorrow thank you so
much for joining us and we will see you
next week
so that will wrap us up for the day i
want to thank everyone for joining us
and again if we didn't get your
question feel free to post as a comment
below and i'll try to get to it this
evening
