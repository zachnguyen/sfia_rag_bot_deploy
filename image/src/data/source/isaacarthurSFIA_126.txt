With Alpha Centauri being the nearest visible
star to us, over 4 light years away, it can
make space seem quite empty, but space is
three-dimensional and thus rises with the
cube of distance, a sphere of space 10 times
wider would contain 1000 times as much space
and typically 1000 times as many stars.
As a result, there are over a hundred stars
within 20 light years of Earth, around a thousand
within 50 light years of Earth, and perhaps
10,000 within 100 light years.
The count and definition can be tricky, because
weâ€™re not sure how close our stellar neighborhood
is to the galactic norm and what should count
as a star, especially in terms of the dim
and hard to see tiny ones like red or brown
dwarfs, which are the supermajority of stars.
Most of these stars will have planets around
them, and while only about 8% of stars are
G-type yellow Suns like our own, all these
worlds may one day be ours, if we reach out
to take them.
