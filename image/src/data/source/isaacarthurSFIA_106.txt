A McKendree Cylinder is a continent-class 
space habitat design that builds off the  
smaller O'Neill Cylinder concept. As large as an 
O’Neill Cylinder is, many miles wide and long,  
there are still many ecosystems or communities 
which might require much more space. The O’Neill  
Cylinder is a space habitat that relies on 
structural steel and aims to be as large as  
that material can safely allow, but was designed 
in the 1970s, prior to discovery of stronger  
materials such as Graphene. It is parallel in 
size to a county and might house a million people,  
while the bigger McKendree Cylinder is larger 
than a country and might house billions. With  
dimensions potentially as large as a thousand 
miles wide and several thousand long, it dwarfs  
its predecessors. Tom McKendree’s habitat offers 
vast spaces in which entire ecosystems, cities,  
nations, and oceans could be recreated, offering a 
semblance of Earth in the depths of space. See our  
episode, the Megastructure Compendium, for more 
examples of truly epic scale space habitats.
