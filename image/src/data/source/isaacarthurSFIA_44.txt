One of my favorite plot points in Frank 
Herbert’s Dune series is that people can  
inherit memory genetically from their parents and 
have a complete catalog of all their ancestors,  
which for most folks nowadays would be many 
billions of people. Dune was written in 1965,  
when DNA was pretty new, and the idea was long 
suggested as the reason why instincts might be  
hereditary, and DNA can store tons of data among 
your trillions of strands, each for about a  
gigabyte. But you only actually got one strand of 
DNA from your parents and for all that it contains  
lots of data, it isn’t enough for anything like 
a chunk of a single person's memory. That said,  
alien biology might easily permit larger 
quantities of DNA to pass to offspring,  
or they might use something like DNA for 
both their genetics and memory storage,  
or even pass it on in the equivalent of mother’s 
milk. So too, in a more cybernetic future,  
we could potentially inherit memories from our 
parents by upload, or anyone else for that matter.
